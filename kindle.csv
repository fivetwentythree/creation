haranguing,,"All the authority of their chief is in his tongue’s end; for he is powerful insofar as he is eloquent; and, even, if he kills himself talking and haranguing, he will not be obeyed unless he pleases the Savages.6 Why and how did it come to pass that hierarchical class societies arose out of communities that had been broadly egalitarian and enjoyed the freedom of “wild ass colts” for many millennia?

quintillion,,"i.org/10.1007/978-1-4842-8847-4_7 138 Chapter 7 | RF and Wireless Technologies By manipulating these two types of energy – electrical energy and wave energy – humanity manages to create, store, and communicate nearly three quintillion bytes of information every day (Bartley, 2021). "
make,,"We just don’t want to just survive uncertainty, to just about make it. "
good,,"This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes (say, chicken soup or steak tartare with a drop of cognac), the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance … even our own existence as a species on this planet. "
tartare,,"This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes (say, chicken soup or steak tartare with a drop of cognac), the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance … even our own existence as a species on this planet. "
preponderates,,"Nonprediction By grasping the mechanisms of antifragility we can build a systematic and broad guide to nonpredictive decision making under uncertainty in business, politics, medicine, and life in general—anywhere the unknown preponderates, any situation in which there is randomness, unpredictability, opacity, or incomplete understanding of things. "
absence,,"Upside at the Expense of Others Which brings us to the largest fragilizer of society, and greatest generator of crises, absence of “skin in the game.” "
wayside,,"My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers by the wayside. "
predisposition,,"Artistic standards are, in this view, nothing more than artefacts of fashion and other cultural accidents, or of individual whim, or of biological predisposition. "
empiricism,,"However, it would be a mistake to dismiss the possibility of objective beauty for that sort of reason, for it is none other than the relic of empiricism that I discussed in Chapter 9 – the assertion that philosophical knowledge in general cannot exist. "
parochial,,"And the reply to that criticism might be, first, that perhaps our arts are merely scratching the surface of what is possible: they are indeed parochial, but they are a first approximation to something universal. "
quasars,,"Or, third, what is the difference between using radio telescopes to understand the physics of quasars and using prosthetic senses (wired into the brain to create new qualia) to appreciate extraterrestrial art? "
qualia,,"Or, third, what is the difference between using radio telescopes to understand the physics of quasars and using prosthetic senses (wired into the brain to create new qualia) to appreciate extraterrestrial art? "
hemlines,,"Was he merely meeting the arbitrary standards of his culture, like the twentieth-century women who carefully adjusted their hemlines each year to conform to the latest fashions? "
suckers,,"Risk management as practiced is the study of an event taking place in the future, and only some economists and other lunatics can claim—against experience—to “measure” the future incidence of these rare events, with suckers listening to them—against experience and the track record of such claims. "
Chartres,,"You can easily tell that your grandmother is more fragile to abrupt changes in temperature than you, that some military dictatorship is more fragile than Switzerland should political change happen, that a bank is more fragile than another should a crisis occur, or that a poorly built modern building is more fragile than the Cathedral of Chartres should an earthquake happen. "
sissy,,"Instead of a discussion of risk (which is both predictive and sissy) I advocate the notion of fragility, which is not predictive—and, unlike risk, has an interesting word that can describe its functional opposite, the nonsissy concept of antifragility. "
Dionysian,,"So thanks to the fragilista, modern culture has been increasingly building blindness to the mysterious, the impenetrable, what Nietzsche called the Dionysian, in life. "
patently,,"Thus I will produce a small number of tricks, directives, and interdicts—how to live in a world we don’t understand, or, rather, how to not be afraid to work with things we patently don’t understand, and, more principally, in what manner we should work with these. "
expedient,,"But their main advantage is that the user knows that they are not perfect, just expedient, and is therefore less fooled by their powers. "
doxastic,,"It is time to revive the not well-known philosophical notion of doxastic commitment, a class of beliefs that go beyond talk, and to which we are committed enough to take personal risks. "
legalese,,"If You See Something Modernity has replaced ethics with legalese, and the law can be gamed with a good lawyer. "
galleys,,"After the mathematical scientist Benoît Mandelbrot read the galleys of The Black Swan, a book dedicated to him, he called me and quietly said: “In what language should I say ‘good luck’ to you?” "
Why,,Why “books”? 
The,,The task here is to build a map of exposures. 
Burke,,"Cato the Elder, Nietzsche, Thales of Miletus, the potency of the system of city-states, the sustainability of artisans, the process of discovery, the onesidedness of opacity, financial derivatives, antibiotic resistance, bottom-up systems, Socrates’ invitation to overrationalize, how to lecture birds, obsessive love, Darwinian evolution, the mathematical concept of Jensen’s inequality, optionality and option theory, the idea of ancestral heuristics, the works of Joseph de Maistre and Edmund Burke, Wittgenstein’s antirationalism, the fraudulent theories of the economics establishment, tinkering and bricolage, terrorism exacerbated by death of its members, an apologia for artisanal societies, the ethical flaws of the middle class, Paleo-style workouts (and nutrition), the idea of medical iatrogenics, the glorious notion of the magnificent (megalopsychon), my obsession with the idea of convexity (and my phobia of concavity), the late-2000s banki"
Damocles,,"CHAPTER 1   Between Damocles and Hydra Please cut my head off—How by some magic, colors become colors—How to lift weight in Dubai"
appellation,,"We gave the appellation “antifragile” to such a package; a neologism was necessary as there is no simple, noncompound word in the Oxford English Dictionary that expresses the point of reverse fragility. "
conflating,,"Even Russian (Soviet version) and Standard Brooklyn English don’t seem to have a designation for antifragility, conflating it with robustness.2 Half of life—the interesting half of life—we don’t have a name for."
fawning,,"In a Roman recycled version of a Greek myth, the Sicilian tyrant Dionysius II has the fawning courtier Damocles enjoy the luxury of a fancy banquet, but with a sword hanging over his head, tied to the ceiling with a single hair from a horse’s tail. "
cogent,,"The story seems cogent, as I myself saw the eighth episode; central Beirut (the ancient part of the city) was completely destroyed for the eighth time during my late childhood, thanks to the brutal civil war. "
inexorable,,"And like the sword, the danger will be silent, inexorable, and discontinuous. "
denigrate,,"If our formal systems of thought denigrate the natural, and in fact we don’t have a name for antifragility, and fight the concept whenever we use our brains, it does not mean that our actions neglect it. "
apophatic,,"We will have ample discussions of the point particularly with the potent notion of the apophatic (what cannot be explicitly said, or directly described, in our current vocabulary); so for now, take this curious phenomenon. "
subsumed,,"Ancient Mediterranean texts, both Greek and Semitic, also had a reduced vocabulary of a small number of colors polarized around the dark and the light—Homer and his contemporaries were limited to about three or four main colors: black, white, and some indeterminate part of the rainbow, often subsumed as red, or yellow. "
reviled,,"Interestingly, it was the British Prime Minister William Gladstone who first made this discovery in the 1850s (and was unfairly and thoughtlessly reviled for it by the usual journalists). "
interregnum,,"Gladstone, quite an erudite, wrote, during his interregnum between political positions, an impressive seventeen-hundred-page treatise on Homer. "
Homeopathy,,"Homeopathy is based on other principles, such as the one that minute, highly diluted parts of the agents of a disease (so small they can hardly be perceptible, hence cannot cause hormesis) can help cure us of the disease itself. "
ambit,,"The ambit of classical physics includes deep questions about the nature of space, time, and change, and we won’t be afraid to sprinkle some philosophical considerations in among our equations. "
widgets,,"Much like how a carpenter might not care about the difference between 30 centimeter or 30.1-centimeter pieces of wood, a business might not care about the difference between $5.00 USD and $5.10 pricing for widgets they buy. "
ribeye,,"It also assumes substitution, so for example if a ribeye steak goes up in price, it factors that out from the basket of goods and switches to cheaper ground beef, since that’s the consumption pattern that the consumer, now facing higher ribeye prices, opts for. "
pervasive,,Domain dependence is pervasive. 
Cato the Censor,,"Many, like the great Roman statesman Cato the Censor, looked at comfort, almost any form of comfort, as a road to waste.1 He did not like it when we had it too easy, as he worried about the weakening of the will. "
stranglehold,,"In the Greek worldview, dominated by the Oedipus complex, it is the next generation which inherits society, while in the Indian worldview, dominated by the Yayati complex, it is the older generation which always dominates society, explaining the stranglehold of tradition over modernity in Indian society. "
mendicant,,"Devapi chose to become a mendicant, refusing to live in Shantanu’s shadow. "
philosopher,,"A brilliant lawyer, diplomat, and philosopher, one of the most active and versatile minds of his century, he learned the new mathematics in an incredibly short time from the physicist Huygens while visiting Paris on a diplomatic mission. "

inter alia,,"In the final charge sheet made by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), all the twenty-six appellants now before us were arraigned as members of the conspiracy, which targeted, inter alia, Rajiv Gandhi. "
supremo,,"After the breaking story of how the conspiracy was hatched, a celebrated journalist from a southern daily accused me of yellow journalism, a fellow crime reporter suggested I was writing fiction, a leading politician from Tamil Nadu labelled me anti-Tamil and the LTTE supremo called me an agent of the CBI in his interview to the Western media. "
threadbare,,The story was better discussed threadbare in person. 
sundry,,"While Chandrasekharan was congratulated by all and sundry for his breakthrough, the SIT was desperately trying to find out the identity of those in the photograph and their antecedents. "
antecedents,,"While Chandrasekharan was congratulated by all and sundry for his breakthrough, the SIT was desperately trying to find out the identity of those in the photograph and their antecedents. "
sulking,,"I still remember those pictures vividly, especially the cover picture which showed a depressed Arjun sulking on his chariot and Krishna trying to raise his spirits with his sermons—a depiction of the scene where the Bhagavad Gita was delivered by Krishna to Arjun. "
beseeched,,"I, King Shantanu of Hastinapur, beg for your mercy,’ he beseeched the gorgeous woman. "
berate,,"He wanted to shout at and berate his wife, but again, he remembered his promise and kept his mouth shut. "
despondent,,Devabrata had never seen his father so despondent. 
foetuses,,"Soon, it will break up into one hundred foetuses. "
tiffin,,Kaarthikeyan looked at his watch and said it was ‘tiffin time’—would Anirudhya like to join him? 
Sure,,‘Sure thing.’ 
cahoots,,Nagarajan was suspected of having been in cahoots with the perpetrators of the crime. 
bogey,,"Selecting the S&P 500 as our bogey was an easy choice because our shareholders, at virtually no cost, can match its performance by holding an index fund. "
supplicant,,"When the financial system went into cardiac arrest in September 2008, Berkshire was a supplier of liquidity and capital to the system, not a supplicant. "
pittance,,The $20 billion-plus of cash-equivalent assets that we customarily hold is earning a pittance at present. 
undercut,,"Most important, none of the changes wrought by Dave have in any way undercut the top-of-the-line standards for safety and service that Rich Santulli, NetJets’ previous CEO and the father of the fractional-ownership industry, insisted upon. "
wrought,,"Most important, none of the changes wrought by Dave have in any way undercut the top-of-the-line standards for safety and service that Rich Santulli, NetJets’ previous CEO and the father of the fractional-ownership industry, insisted upon. "
overhang,,"There were three ways to cure this overhang: (1) blow up a lot of houses, a tactic similar to the destruction of autos that occurred with the “cash-for-clunkers” program; (2) speed up household formations by, say, encouraging teenagers to cohabitate, a program not likely to suffer from a lack of volunteers or; (3) reduce new housing starts to a number far below the rate of household formations. "
punitive,,The second reason that manufactured housing is troubled is specific to the industry: the punitive differential in mortgage rates between factory-built homes and site-built homes. 
delinquencies,,"Even today, though job-loss troubles have grown, Clayton’s delinquencies and defaults remain reasonable and will not cause us significant problems. "
derelict,,************ In my view a board of directors of a huge financial institution is derelict if it does not insist that its CEO bear full responsibility for risk control. 
botched,,It has not been shareholders who have botched the operations of some of our country’s largest financial institutions. 
gawker,,"If you are a big spender — or, for that matter, merely a gawker — visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of the Omaha airport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. "
Woodstock,,So join us on May 1st at the Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists. 
households,,That devastating supply/demand equation is now reversed: Every day we are creating more households than housing units. 
smoldering,,"The charred gash in the northwest face of the Pentagon, just minutes up the George Washington Parkway from where you and your colleagues are still coming to grips with what has happened, is smoldering. "
overarching,,"Eventually, we shared an overarching, driving passion: to be able to know whether or not a person is telling the truth. "
stickler,,"A stickler for doing his homework, Phil reviewed Omar’s file like he was preparing to coach his beloved East Carolina University Pirates in a game against Virginia Tech. "
myopia,,This is a fine observation – if you want expose the pettiness and myopia of the critics. 
chutzpah,,"Never before had I heard a venerated businessperson express such trenchant insights about investing, finance, and the world more broadly, and with such—to use a favored Munger phrase—chutzpah. "
sulk,,Seek a partner who will never second-guess you nor sulk when you make expensive mistakes. 
affirmative,,"Often, as in this case, Charlie generally focuses first on what to avoid—that is, on what not to do—before he considers the affirmative steps he will take in a given situation. "
The,,"Guns, Germs, and Steel, The Selfish Gene, Ice Age, and Darwin’s Blind Spot all have a certain theme: a focus on the issue of competitive destruction and an examination of why some entities are nevertheless able to adapt, survive, and even dominate over time. "
Spot,,"Guns, Germs, and Steel, The Selfish Gene, Ice Age, and Darwin’s Blind Spot all have a certain theme: a focus on the issue of competitive destruction and an examination of why some entities are nevertheless able to adapt, survive, and even dominate over time. "
gestalt,,"Rather, each must be considered as part of the complex whole or gestalt of the investment analysis process, in much the same way that an individual tile is integral to the larger mosaic in which it appears. "
Disraeli,,"For those of you who want misery, I also recommend refraining from the practice of the Disraeli compromise, designed for people who find it impossible to quit resentment cold turkey. "
vicariously,,"My second prescription for misery is to learn everything you possibly can from your own experience, minimizing what you learn vicariously from the good and bad experiences of others, living and dead. "
waltzing,,"So, emphasizing what I sometimes waggishly call remedial worldly wisdom, I’m going to start by waltzing you through a few basic notions. "
facile,,I don’t think it’s necessary for most people to be terribly facile in statistics. 
breakpoints,,"The engineering idea of breakpoints, that’s a very powerful model too. "
dolled,,It’s just been dolled up a little bit with fancy lingo. 
antipathy,,"CBS provides an interesting example of another rule of psychology, namely Pavlovian association.17 If people tell you what you really don’t want to hear, what’s unpleasant, there’s an almost automatic reaction of antipathy. "
indignation,,Those of you who are in the investing profession are probably bristling with indignation right now. 
temerity,,And I have the temerity to tell you that you are not taking your job seriously? 
turnaround,,"Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species, chapter 3, “Struggle for Existence” We have written in past reports about the disappointments that usually result from purchases and operation of “turnaround” businesses. "
marquee,,"The business had a reasonable scale by Indian standards, and the company had many marquee clients, including one of India’s largest businesses. "
ungulates,,"From the fossil record, we know that the deer that we see today evolved from ungulates about fifteen to thirty million years ago.3 They have survived millions of years amid ferocious predators by being very sensitive to making type I errors—errors of not being too careful. "
and,,"Natural selection among animals is incessant and merciless and has produced millions of species, all of whom adhere to this simple principle: Minimize the risk of committing type I errors to curtail the risk of injury or death, and learn to live with type II errors or foregone benefits. "
foregone,,"Natural selection among animals is incessant and merciless and has produced millions of species, all of whom adhere to this simple principle: Minimize the risk of committing type I errors to curtail the risk of injury or death, and learn to live with type II errors or foregone benefits. "
swindled,,"14 This was a polite way of saying, “Beware of being swindled.” "
veracity,,I also should have dug deeper into the veracity of the criticisms of the promoter. 
Receivables,,"Receivables, inventory, payables, fixed assets. "
wrought,,You can now guess the answer to the question I raised at the beginning of this section: The common thread that binds eighteenth-century railways and twentieth-century dot-coms is the potential for enormous value destruction wrought by a fast-changing industry. 
nascent,,"But the infrastructure business in India was in a fledgling state in the late 2000s, the regulations were nascent and untested, and the basis of long-term success was unclear. "
gung,,"In a remarkably bold strategic move, Lal decided to divest thirteen of the fifteen businesses to focus on just two products: trucks and motorcycles.30 Almost every analyst was gung ho about the future of Eicher; they were all taken in by its dynamic leader who was aggressively culling businesses, something that Indian firms rarely did. "
culling,,"to divest thirteen of the fifteen businesses to focus on just two products: trucks and motorcycles.30 Almost every analyst was gung ho about the future of Eicher; they were all taken in by its dynamic leader who was aggressively culling businesses, something that Indian firms rarely did. "
diktat,,"Buffett’s two rules of investing (never lose money, and don’t forget to never lose money) are essentially a diktat for eliminating significant risks. "
asserted,,"Chapter 2 The Siberian Solution Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet. "
naught,,Dmitri’s project carried a lot of risk and could come to naught. 
receivable,,"For every company, you see a gazillion pieces of information on tap: revenue growth, profit growth, debt level, margin profile, stock price movement, analysts’ views, bond ratings, Twitter commentary, shareholder information, top management résumés, conference call transcripts, annual reports, quarterly filings, media coverage, competitor profiles, shares bought or sold by senior management, receivable and inventory levels, CEO statements, Reddit threads, hedge fund ownership, and so much more. "
One,,One alternative would be to use a two-step process that we use at Nalanda. 
Margins,,"Margins can mean many things: gross margin (sales minus cost of goods sold divided by sales), EBITDA margin (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization divided by sales), or EBIT margin (earnings before interest and tax divided by sales). "
piecemeal,,"Dmitri and Lyudmila’s experiment, now running for more than sixty years, has demonstrated that evolution does not occur piecemeal. "
pertinent,,We further need to be alive to the pertinent silences—the omissions and unmentionables—that surround even the loudest controversies and the most vocal speakers. 
petard,,"(The protagonist is desperate to learn this technique so that he can avoid paying his debts, but he is caught on his own petard when his own son uses it to justify beating him.) "
vicarious,,And you’ve got to array your experience—both vicarious and direct—on this latticework of models. 
expediency,,"His was an argument of expediency, of realpolitik: killing all the Mytilenean men would not be in the “interests” of the Athenians. "
muskets,,"France is peopled with ‘patriots in red caps and tricoloured cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres’, sullen and suspicious, who instinctively curse all ‘aristocrats’. "
usurper,,"The novel’s characters, from Czar Alexander downwards, are at the same time impressed and repelled by the Corsican usurper and what he stands for. "
mettle,,"A grave injustice had been done to his father when his younger brother Pandu was made the king of Hastinapur, for Dhritarashtra had proven his mettle after Pandu had passed. "
frolic,,"After enjoying all the fun and frolic, the boys would enjoy a grand feast. "
umpteen,,The royal cooks would prepare umpteen delicious dishes for the princes. 
banyan,,He lay down in the shade of the banyan tree by the river bank. 
stoop,,"They knew Duryodhan and Dushasana were evil-minded, but they could never imagine that the Kauravas could stoop so low. "

imbecile,,"Those imbecile kings, they lined up like peasants to pay these pretenders their taxes. "
sulk,,That’s nothing to sulk about. 
clarinet,,"Someone produces a clarinet and, wandering among the trees that crowd the water’s edge, begins to play. "
outdoorsman,,"cts and other ‘elaborately constructed forms, so different from one another’ were produced by the complex forces of evolution, yet depended utterly on one another.15 Perhaps the briefest but most resonant description of ecological thought is that given in 1911 by John Muir, the Scottish-American naturalist, outdoorsman and father of the US National Park system. "
hitched,,"Reflecting on the abundance of complex life he encountered while writing his book My First Summer in the Sierra, he wrote simply: ‘When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.’"
surgeonfish,,"Crucially, those relationships extend to things as well as beings: ecology is just as interested in how the availability of nesting materials affects bird populations, or how urban planning shapes the spread of diseases, as it is in how honeybees pollinate marigolds and cleaner wrasses delouse surgeonfish. "
permeates,,"Ecological thought, once unleashed, permeates everything. "
humdrum,,"The self-driving car is one of those technologies which in the space of just a few years has gone from space-age, ‘Life in the Twenty-First Century’ fantasy to humdrum reality, without ever passing through a period of critical reflection or assimilation. "
assimilation,,"The self-driving car is one of those technologies which in the space of just a few years has gone from space-age, ‘Life in the Twenty-First Century’ fantasy to humdrum reality, without ever passing through a period of critical reflection or assimilation. "
flâneur,,"In this, my approach owed more to the flâneur than the engineer. "
dérive,,"In the twentieth century, the figure of the flâneur was picked up by proponents of the dérive, or drift: a way of combating the malaise and boredom of modern life through unplanned walks, attentiveness to one’s surroundings and encounters with unexpected events. "
malaise,,"In the twentieth century, the figure of the flâneur was picked up by proponents of the dérive, or drift: a way of combating the malaise and boredom of modern life through unplanned walks, attentiveness to one’s surroundings and encounters with unexpected events. "
umwelt,,"2 As well as getting lost, I was trying to think of ways to illustrate what I was coming to think of as the umwelt of my self-driving car. "
chutzpah,,"My video of the Autonomous Trap subsequently went viral, and I have the feeling that people appreciated the chutzpah and the whiff of black magic more than the collaboration: in an age of Uber, air pollution, mass automation and corporate AI, there’s something pleasing about stopping the robot in its tracks. "
corral,,"In transferring this analogy to the world of AI, it seems evident that thus far we have mostly created domesticated machines of the first kind, we have begun to corral a feedlot of the second, and we live in fear of unleashing the third. "
interlocutors,,"Turing called his method for doing this ‘the imitation game’: he imagined a set-up in which an interviewer interrogated two hidden interlocutors – one human, one machine – and tried to tell which was which. "
solipsistic,,"It is testament to our solipsistic way of thinking that this is still what we consider to be a benchmark for general artificial intelligence today.5 In fairness to Turing, his idea was a bit more complicated than that. "
posited,,"One of the most famous objections was posited by the very first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace, when she was working on Charles Babbage’s early computer design, the Analytical Engine, in the middle of the nineteenth century. "
conditioned reflex,,"He believed that, as technology progressed, it would be possible to design circuitry which could adapt itself to new inputs and thus new behaviours – a kind of ‘conditioned reflex’, similar to that of animals, leading to ‘learning’. "
adjudicate,,"(The argument concerning the immortal soul, on the other hand, is somewhat harder to adjudicate.) "
intimation,,"Here we find an intimation, at the very founding of the discipline of artificial intelligence, that machine intelligence is somehow different from human intelligence. "
disdained,,"What was more, gibbons showed the same attitude in many kinds of tests: they refused to pick up cups as part of a response test, and disdained to investigate upturned containers in search of treats. "
tractable,,"One researcher, writing in 1932 about a white-handed gibbon named Charlotte, did concede that ‘conceivably these errors may have been caused by lack of interest and motivation rather than by any intellectual deficiency, as our animal, although perfectly tame and tractable, evinced frequently a total indifference to the entire experimental situation.’ "
brachiators,,The 1967 experiment was designed to account for the fact that gibbons are brachiators. 
doldrums,,Shakuni’s inspiring speech lifted Duryodhan from the doldrums. 
fusiform,,"Neurologically, we have become hard-wired to pick out faces; there is even an area of the visual cortex – the fusiform face area – responsible for recognising and remembering them.3 Nowadays, spotting Jesus in a piece of burnt toast makes for a diverting newspaper story, but sometimes, these long-honed pattern-recognition skills,"
pernicious,,We will discover more of the pernicious impacts of normalcy bias in Chapter 9. 
stymie,,"As I will highlight in the final chapter, chaos can stymie our attempts to make vital forecasts about what, in theory, should be predictable systems: the populations of endangered animal species, the trajectories of epidemic spread, the behaviour of crowds and, of course, the weather. "
lots,,"The practices are grouped under the umbrella term cleromancy – a Latinised combination of the Greek kleros, meaning lots (as in casting lots) and the suffix mancy, meaning divination. "
astragali,,"The original dice used were not the regular, number-scored cubes we use in games of chance today, but unadulterated animal bones – specifically, the cuboid-like ankle bones, or astragali, of sheep, pigs, goats and deer. "
platitudes,,"These general platitudes, known as Barnum statements12 (named for American businessman, showman and renowned psychological manipulator Phineas Taylor Barnum), constitute a common opening gambit for psychics and are clearly a safe place for Paula to start to learn more about"
gambit,,"These general platitudes, known as Barnum statements12 (named for American businessman, showman and renowned psychological manipulator Phineas Taylor Barnum), constitute a common opening gambit for psychics and are clearly a safe place for Paula to start to learn more about me. "
tacit,,Denying the understanding of the psychic’s point might be perceived as a tacit admission of stupidity. 
scant,,that Paula reaches for after almost every statement leaves scant room for disagreement. 
extort,,"The first was a conflict that broke out between this country and France in 1797, when the French ministers in Paris attempted to extort a bribe of $240,000 from American diplomats as the price for recognizing them and their mission. "
intrigues,,The Federalist majority in Congress decided to pass a series of laws that they felt would help combat foreign intrigues and conspiracies in the United States. 
Sedition,,"These were the Alien and Sedition Acts, passed in June and July 1798, which placed restrictions on both citizens and aliens. "
redress,,"These Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, as they were called, condemned the Alien and Sedition Acts as unconstitutional and affirmed the right of the states to judge for themselves “the mode and measure of redress” whenever the national government assumed powers not specifically delegated to it by the Constitution. "
excoriating,,"Toward the end of the campaign, Hamilton himself published a fifty-four-page pamphlet excoriating Adams for his public conduct and defects of character, citing his reputed weakness, vacillation, and ungovernable temper. "

called,,The acquisition of Alaska was called “Seward’s Folly.” 
comparing,,"Roosevelt called them “muckrakers,” comparing them to the man with the muckrake in John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, who never sees what is around him because he is forever looking down at the filth he is raking. "

contrived,,A fast-and-easy cooking magazine I picked up recently seemed contrived to scare its readers off.

shipwright,,"Using the old mixed constructions, the millwright and the coachbuilder, the shipwright and the rigger, needed a very high degree of skill, though of course they had their blind spots and they made the sort of mistakes one might expect from men without a formal analytical training. "
Using,,"Using the old mixed constructions, the millwright and the coachbuilder, the shipwright and the rigger, needed a very high degree of skill, though of course they had their blind spots and they made the sort of mistakes one might expect from men without a formal analytical training. "

girders,,Once he has settled in his rut of metal cogwheels and girders the engineer takes a lot of shifting. 
imposition,,These arise from the imposition of the law of the conservation of energy and describe the internal state of the system. 
sophists,,"We receive stimuli from the external world, (although some sophists have been known to deny the existence of the external world, we shall adopt a form of the “naive realism” position that the world exists and is to some extent “knowable”). "
thrilling,,"Had I skimmed it too rapidly, I might have missed the chapter in which he gives us the thrilling examples of literary doublespeak with which Paul Valéry eulogized Marcel Proust and Anatole France while making it quite clear that he had hardly read a word of their work. "
doublespeak,,"Had I skimmed it too rapidly, I might have missed the chapter in which he gives us the thrilling examples of literary doublespeak with which Paul Valéry eulogized Marcel Proust and Anatole France while making it quite clear that he had hardly read a word of their work. "
MILIEU,,"Preface BORN INTO A MILIEU where reading was rare, deriving little pleasure from the activity, and lacking in any case the time to devote myself to it, I have often found myself in the delicate situation of having to express my thoughts on books I haven’t read. "
mendacity,,"Among specialists, mendacity is the rule, and we tend to lie in proportion to the significance of the book under consideration. "
assuage,,"It is to help assuage such guilt, at least in part, that is the goal of this book. "
books,,"It is all the more difficult to reflect on unread books and the discussions they engender because the concept of non-reading is itself unclear, and so it is often hard to know whether we’re lying or not when we say that we’ve read a book. "
engender,,"It is all the more difficult to reflect on unread books and the discussions they engender because the concept of non-reading is itself unclear, and so it is often hard to know whether we’re lying or not when we say that we’ve read a book. "
frivolous,,"Most engineers have had no aesthetic training at all, and the tendency in the schools of engineering is to despise such matters as frivolous. "
deflection,,"Again, furniture designers, incredibly, are not taught during their formal training how to calculate the deflection in an ordinary bookshelf when it is loaded with books, and so it is not very surprising that most of them seem to have no ideas about relating the appearance to the structure of their products."
erstwhile,,"1 That combination of military power and religious–personal authority connected to Julius Caesar allowed the younger Caesar to accrue new forms of political power, for example, summoning the Senate without any official authority to do so in 32 BCE, and then getting each of the municipalities in Italy to demand that he lead them in a last wave of battle against his erstwhile ally now allied with the queen of Egypt.2 Octavian did not abolish the republican magistracies. "
magistracies,,"This chapter discusses ‘sovereignty’ not as the translation of any one particular Latin word, but rather as the emperors’ evolving set of powers, which combined, augmented or superseded the highest powers of the republican magistracies. "
tantamount,,Now it became possible to see Rome itself as tantamount to a single cosmopolitan community. 
notwithstanding,,"Each chapter is centred around an idea, while each idea in turn is presented as emblematic of a particular time, place or author, notwithstanding the fact that each was also explored in many others."
hinterland,,"A polis was a particular kind of territory and settlement, combining an urban core, often walled, with a region of agricultural hinterland. "
pillagers,,"(Famously, at one stage in their 5th-century wars with Sparta, the Athenians followed the advice of the general and orator Pericles and abandoned their countryside to the pillagers, crowding together in the urban core of the polis under the protection of the Long Walls, where they continued to care for ta politika together.) "
manumission,,"In another way, too, Roman citizenship was dramatically expansive and inclusive, because slaves who were freed by means of recognized civic procedures thereby became citizens (unlike in Greece).6 Still, relatively few of these new citizens created by manumission (i.e., by being freed) or incorporation could come to Rome in practice to attend the assemblies where officials were elected and laws passed. "
jockeying,,Each polis community was vulnerable to invasion and so was constantly jockeying for advantage and sometimes even permanent domination over its neighbours. 
eschewing,,"Some democracies, most conspicuously Athens, innovated further in using large popular juries to decide almost all legal cases and eschewing professional judges, taking such power out of the hands of archaic aristocratic bodies. "
augurs,,"The Greeks and Romans controlled the timing of political actions in diverse and complex ways: the Athenians timed the speeches in jury trials by means of a water-clock, for example; while the Romans consulted augurs, priests who were charged with determining when crucial political or military actions should be taken in accordance with divine favour.7 Within institutions, opportunities to act were carefully prescribed and allocated; outside them, an ambitious man might perceive and seize the opportunity to rewrite the rules and take"
plebeian,,"Chapter 4, the lineage began with Socrates, who questioned his fellow Athenians incessantly about the nature of justice, knowledge and virtue; it continued with Plato, his pupil, born to a privileged family but in thrall to the ugly plebeian Socrates, and the source of our most scintillating writings about him; and then, turning to Chapter 5, it was passed on to Aristotle, who came from a family serving the Macedonian court in northern Greece to join the Academy that Plato had established in Athens, later setting up a rival school of his own. "

"
clambered,,"That undermining was witnessed a century later by the philosopher and statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero, who had clambered up the ladder of power and honour by sheer exertion of public speaking, but at the same time studied and debated zealously with philosophers of many schools in Rome and also in Athens. "
embellished,,"Within Rome, he embellished the original Greek idea of the monarchical constitution, envisioning how the virtues of mercy and liberality could be fostered in the princeps. "
tussle,,"A small farmer embittered by losing a tussle over family land to his brother, Hesiod claims to have risen above his loss by taking the high road, writing an ambitious poem, Erga kai Hemerai (Works and Days), to instruct his brother in how to farm. "
hoi polloi,,"m which we get our word ‘aristocracy’; in Athens, their families were known as the Eupatridae, the well-born.2 Sometimes they simply called themselves, or were called by others, hoi oligoi, the few, contrasted with hoi polloi, the many. "
insolence,,"Solon claimed to have combated hubris – the violence and insolence that threaten justice – by the establishment of eunomia, or a condition of good laws and law-abidingness. "
strife,,"Indeed, while both sides agreed to abide by Solon’s proposed constitution in order to put an end to civil strife, neither side liked it. "
precocious,,"After two years at Morton's, and probably at his instigation, the precocious boy was sent to further his education at Oxford. "
chagrin,,"During his years at Oxford and as a law student, however (and reportedly to his father's chagrin), More came increasingly under the influence of a group of literary scholars, central figures of the emerging tradition of Renaissance humanism in England. "
cognates,,"‘Humanism’ is a nineteenth-century coinage; but ‘humanist’ (like its cognates in other European languages) is found in the Renaissance itself, where it derived, first as Italian university-student slang, from studia humanitatis, a Ciceronian phrase that came to designate a family of disciplines comprising grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy.3 In the Renaissance as in the Mi"
Lord Chancellor,,"In March 1518, he entered Henry VIII's council.5 His duties in this role spanned a broad range of activities, but his central employment, before he became Lord Chancellor, in 1529, was as secretary to the King. "
declamation,,"Erasmus reports a lost dialogue, evidently in the spirit of a declamation, defending the community of wives advocated in Plato's Republic. "
polemical,,"Several of More's longer, polemical letters of these years belong to the rhetorical genre of invective. "
Flanders,,"In May of that year, More left England for Flanders, as a member of a royal trade commission. "
Antwerp,,"At some point in the summer More visited Antwerp, where he met Peter Giles (Pieter Gillis), to whom Erasmus had recommended him. "
perennial,,"Although the social problems Utopia addresses are perennial, the particular formulations of them, and the data of recent and contemporary English and European life that the book deploys, reflect More's personal and professional experience. "
antecedents,,"lised account of the imaginary polity as if it actually existed.10 The debate that occupies almost all of Book I of Utopia also has classical (and humanist) antecedents, and complex relationships to them. "
garrison,,After much persuasion and expostulation he got Amerigo’s permission to be one of the twenty-four men who were left in a garrison at the farthest point of the last voyage. 
mischief,,"There is some danger that through their imprudence this device, which they thought would be so advantageous to them, may become the cause of much mischief. "
fledgling,,"It’s only natural, of course, that each man should think his own inventions best: the crow loves his fledgling and the ape his cub. "
misgivings,,"As a matter of fact, we have no misgivings about neglecting the best examples they have left us; but if on some point their deliberations could have been more prudent, we immediately and eagerly seize the excuse of reverence for times past and cling to it desperately. "
mainspring,,and he seemed the mainspring of all public affairs. 
swaggering,,"And country folk dare not do so, for they don’t have to be told that one who has been raised softly to idle pleasures, who has been used to swaggering about like a bully with sword and buckler, is likely to look down on the whole neighbourhood and despise everybody else as beneath him. "

expedient,,"Your policy may look superficially like justice, but in reality it is neither just nor expedient. "

tantamount,,"Sometimes we have little or no historical data to guide us and proactive experimentation is impossible, impractical, or tantamount to a decision to proceed. "
restitution,,"‘ “In their land, whoever is found guilty of theft must make restitution to the owner, not (as elsewhere) to the prince;38 they think the prince has* precisely as much right to the stolen goods as the thief himself. "
reprieve,,"But perhaps when the death sentence has been passed on a thief, the king might reprieve him for a time without right of sanctuary,39 and thus see how the plan worked. "
dogged,,"We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. "
stroboscopic,,"Lecture 2: Motion Lenny complained, “George, this jumpy stroboscopic stuff makes me nervous. "
sham,,"Defined as the exercise of sovereign power, or the unfettered enjoyment of imperial rule (the criteria still favoured by many historians), the British Empire in its heyday was largely a sham. "
perdition,,"He called him a knave, a slanderer, a sneak and a “son of perdition”,43 quoting the meanwhile terrible denunciations from Holy Scripture. "
cybernetics,,"Many kinds of systems have been studied and the fields that have considered them are quite varied: general systems theory, cybernetics, and studies in artificial intelligence in the 1950s; dynamic systems theory in the 1960s; and chaos theory in the 1970s. "

Getz,,"So I spent the afternoons and evenings listening to Parker, Armstrong, Ellington, and then Goodman and Getz. "
insipid,,I did play once—it was during my sophomore year—when I allowed beer and the enthusiastic goading of Peter Cage to overcome my self-consciousness and banged out an insipid “The Way You Look Tonight” on the piano. 
schmuck,,"Instead, she went back to her notebook, leaving me standing there, feeling like a schmuck. "

Antipathies,,"The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening,"
curtseying,,(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air!

sucker,,Technology can degrade (and endanger) every aspect of a sucker’s life while convincing him that it is becoming more “efficient.” 
finesse,,"Only in recent history has “working hard” signaled pride rather than shame for lack of talent, finesse, and, mostly, sprezzatura. "
sprezzatura,,"Only in recent history has “working hard” signaled pride rather than shame for lack of talent, finesse, and, mostly, sprezzatura. "
hypochondria,,"There is a distinction between expressive hypochondria and literature, just as there is one between self-help and philosophy. "

portents,,"Armed with home supercomputers and chained processors, and helped by complexity and “chaos” theories, the scientists, semiscientists, and pseudoscientists will be able to find portents. "
induction,,It is called the problem of induction. 
redoubtable,,"Having lost a battle to the redoubtable Persian king Cyrus, he was about to be burned alive when he called Solon’s name and shouted (something like) “Solon, you were right” (again this is legend). "
public utility,,"Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public utility. "
preamble,,"The United States did not establish its own Bill of Rights until a year after the French; and whereas the French declaration was meant as a preamble enshrining basic principles of a constitution, the American Bill was a series of afterthoughts, amendments to an already-existing constitution. "
knee-jerk,,"The same knee-jerk reaction that makes it difficult to take Einstein’s words seriously also keeps us from understanding what this mathematician (René Descartes) is trying to tell us, and keeps us from placing his book (Discourse on Method) where it belongs: in the self-improvement section. "
friends,,"No man is an Iland, intire of itselfe; every man is a peece of the Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod bee washed away by the Sea, Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well as if a Manor of thy friends or of thine owne were; any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; and therefore never send to know for whom the [funeral] bell tolls; It tolls for thee.

aqueducts,,"The bath houses, or therms, were monumental buildings supplied by aqueducts with water from distant mountains. "

Liturgical,,him pass; the Secretary of the College and the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations followed him. 
reproached,,He reproached himself. 
flummery,,was felt to be too large and too multinational for such Renaissance flummery. 
hankered,,"Still, there was a part of Lomeli that rather hankered after Renaissance flummery, and privately he thought the late Pope had"
ostentation,,"An excess of simplicity, after all, was just another form of ostentation, and pride in one’s humility a sin. "
Curia,,hostel for some of the priests working in the bureaucracy of the Curia. 
flippancy,,"Grothendieck’s detachment and flippancy might seem incomprehensible, but when you know more about his intellectual approach, you’ll find it perfectly coherent. "
finesse,,"Nothing prevents us from working harder and crafting a language that will capture with more and more finesse what it means for a star to be more or less pointed, more or less elongated, more or less distorted, and so on. "
injunction,,But the verb to think doesn’t mean much since it’s been used as an injunction to submit to System 2. 
reverie,,"In order to understand mathematics, you have to train yourself to bring together imagination and language, intuition and logic, reverie and calculation, seeing both the big picture and the details. "
philistine,,Then she came to realize that Cyril was a thick-headed philistine incapable of appreciating her talent. 
brasserie,,"Adèle and her colleagues enter a dirty little brasserie and, as always, Bertrand says, a bit too loud: “We weren’t supposed to come back here, remember? "
coy,,"Her colleagues look coy, halfheartedly shake their heads, claim they can’t afford it. "
debauchery,,"The newspaper’s Christmas party is an institution: a moment of planned debauchery, where the aim is to go as wild as possible, to reveal your true self to colleagues with whom your relations will, the next day, become purely professional again. "
trombone,,"At Harvard, students he shared university housing with recalled two details: his habit of playing the trombone in the middle of the night, and the smell of rotting food that came from under his door. "
malaise,,It comes across as a feeling of malaise. 
preoccupations,,"Certain passages betray preoccupations that you wouldn’t expect from your typical terrorist: “It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of scientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective reality can be defined. "
mores,,"Nevertheless, the values to which a majority subscribe at any given time determine society’s economic and political structures and social mores. "
vapid,,"A research student who had arrived earlier that year—a young man with a beard and a vapid expression—left after a few minutes, explaining that he had to pick up his car from the garage. "
cravats,,"Preface The familiar essayist didn’t speak to the millions; he spoke to one reader, as if the two of them were sitting side by side in front of a crackling fire with their cravats loosened, their favorite stimulants at hand, and a long evening of conversation stretching before them. "
desist,,"Anne Fadiman, At Large and At Small It is not incumbent upon you to finish the work, yet neither are you free to desist from it. "
asymptotic,,"Mathematical techniques that we use throughout the book, such as asymptotic notation and discrete probability, are discussed in the Appendix. "
beseech,,"“O Euler, come and walk with us,” Those burghers did beseech. "
burghers,,"“O Euler, come and walk with us,” Those burghers did beseech. "
complete,,"In general, the number of nodes in this search tree grows exponentially with the number of vertices of the underlying graph, so traversing the entire tree—either finding a leaf with a complete path, or learning that every possible path gets stuck—takes exponential time. "
Father Christmases,,"Some Father Christmases and trees decorated with tinsel sprinkled the half-empty room, essentially occupied by small groups of old people, some very old, who chewed carefully, consciously, and even ferociously on dishes of traditional cuisine. "
patisserie,,"There were wild boar, suckling pig, and turkey; for dessert, of course, a patisserie Yule log à l’ancienne was proposed by the house, whose polite and discreet waiters operated in silence, as if in a burn unit. "
conviviality,,"It was pathetic and vain to want to establish a gastronomical conviviality that had no raison d’être, and which had not even conceivably ever had one—his mother, while she was alive, had always hated cooking. "
suckling,,"For the time being, he chewed laboriously on his suckling pig, with about the same expression as if it were a piece of rubber; nothing indicated that he wanted to break the lengthening silence, and Jed, being nervous (he should never have drunk Gewürztraminer with the oysters—he’d realized that from the moment he had ordered, since white wine always made his mind fuzzy), looked frenetically for some subject that might lend itself to conversation. "
the,,"Peering through the foliage, one can get a general idea of the size and shape of the site, especially by climbing to a high spot. "
gnawing,,Some even started running after me so they could ask me the questions that were gnawing at them: “Is it true what you say in your book? 
chastened,,"Newly chastened, I went to work as never before: I began writing at six in the morning and didn’t stop until nine or ten at night, carried away by the frenzy of despair. "
shiksa,,She was such a sweet shiksa. 
cognoscenti,,In effect the tools become the property of an inadvertent cognoscenti. 
snubbed,,"He was said to have a potbelly, an odd nose (perhaps snubbed), and eyes with a bulging quality.2 There are jokes about him seeing to the sides like a crab.3 Socrates was widely credited with turning philosophy from the study of nature to hard questions in ordinary life—to have made it, in other words,"
stringent,,"In addition to the stringent control of the steady-state level of glucose, the entire glucose dynamics after a meal is tightly regulated. "
undershoot,,"This resembles the measured response of healthy people, including a slight glucose undershoot before returning to baseline. "
bestial,,"I have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial. "
culling,,"Because—and Blake apologizes—when a health minister makes cuts in the budget, culling a scanner here, a doctor there, and an ICU bed somewhere else, that minister knows that he or she’s appreciably shortening the lives of thousands of strangers. "
depraved,,He’s not depraved. 
wine-bibbing,,"It is bad, and very bad, because it is medical wine-bibbing. "
obnoxious,,"In his famous autobiography, A Mathematician’s Apology, a book that was once considered a classic but, to modern readers, seems plainly obnoxious, Hardy goes so far as to proclaim this malediction: “There is no scorn more profound, or on the whole more justifiable, than that of the men who make for the men who explain. "
reticence,,"By now, I have no cause to fear how I will be judged, which makes it much easier for me” speaks to the theme taken up in the epilogue: in order to recount the human experience of understanding, mathematicians need to overcome the reticence of their community to discuss subjects that “aren’t serious.” "
mutt,,"Blake’s mother runs in every direction, panicking, she covers Blake’s eyes with her hand, stammers incoherently, she wants to call an ambulance, But, Mom, it’s a mutt, it’s just a mutt. "
awning,,"He pretends to be out of breath, bends double under the effects of an imaginary stitch, and also like every other day, looks up and waves to a man in the distance, a slightly chubby fiftysomething who’s leaning on the balustrade, drinking a coffee under the awning. "

Novocain,,"In any case, randomness seems to operate either as a cure or as Novocain! "
ergodicity,,"Repetitiveness is key for the revelation of skills because of what I called ergodicity in Chapter 8—the detection of long-term properties, particularly when these exist. "
tenuous,,The link between the skill of the CEO and the results of the company are tenuous. 
accentuated,,"It is just that, with the acceleration of the power law–style winner-takes-all effects in our environment, such differences in outcomes are more accentuated, more visible, and more offensive to people’s sense of fairness. "
hoe,,"It was once said that “civilization is a parasite on the man with the hoe,”33 but the man with the hoe no longer exists; he is now a “hand” at the wheel of a tractor or a combine. "
latifundia,,"To compete with these latifundia the little man had to borrow money at rates that insured his inability to pay; slowly he sank into poverty or bankruptcy, tenancy or the slums. "
proletariat,,"How could Roman life and democracy ever be healthy with a city proletariat festering in poverty, instead of a proud yeomanry owning and tilling the land? "

Carthage,,"He fed the ambitions of the middle classes by establishing new colonies in Capua, Tarentum, Narbo, and Carthage, and by developing these as thriving centers of trade. "
bodkin,,"When Hamlet, in the most famous speech in the English language (To be or not to be), refers to something called a bodkin, most of us just scratch our heads and want to give up. "
The,,"The Stories and Characters Along with the passages themselves, we’ll teach your children the plots and characters to go with them. "

primrose,,Where oxlips Where oxlips Where oxlips Where oxlips An oxlip is another kind of flower (a hybrid between a cowslip and a primrose). 
cowslip,,Where oxlips Where oxlips Where oxlips Where oxlips An oxlip is another kind of flower (a hybrid between a cowslip and a primrose). 
specious,,"He may have been unfair in his treatment of the original Sophists, but he was surely not wrong to be concerned about the specious use of language by politicians and lawyers. "
fizzle,,"What I mean, Marcus, is that you are a terrific guy, but there’s a good chance you will just fizzle out if you don’t get your ass in gear. "
assailed,,"Apparently, on the night Nola was identified, journalists assailed David Kellergan in his home. "
grandstand,,"But if he’s guilty, you can be sure I will not let Roth grandstand the jury into acquitting a criminal. "
parish,,"This is just one of the many stark, sobering sentences found in a report submitted by the Cholera Inquiry Committee in July 1855, about a particularly severe outbreak of the disease that had struck a London parish the previous year. "

patently,,"All this was patently wrong, but, again, only in hindsight. "
intromission,,"He proposed a new type of intromission, one that relied not on bits of matter leaving an object and entering our eyes but, rather, one that required light radiating out in straight lines from every point of a colored object. "
notwithstanding,,"Cave dwellers and Alhazen’s seminal work notwithstanding, the first mathematical mention of the nearest neighbor rule appeared in a 1951 technical report of the U.S. "
ephemera,,Storytellers ignore the ephemera. 
corsage,,A white corsage is pinned to her dress. 
pariahs,,"Outsiders, outcasts and pariahs are plentiful in contemporary fiction and in submissions to my agency. "
impetus,,"Nothing, perhaps, has given more impetus to the later development of topology than the great structure of Riemann’s theory of functions, in which topological concepts are absolutely fundamental. "
Mithras,,"Is the life story of the founder of Christianity the product of human sorrow, imagination, and hope—a myth comparable to the legends of Krishna, Osiris, Attis, Adonis, Dionysus, and Mithras? "
interpolation,,"2   There may be a genuine core in these strange lines; but the high praise given to Christ by a Jew uniformly anxious to please either the Romans or the Jews—both at that time in conflict with Christianity—renders the passage suspect, and Christian scholars reject it as almost certainly an interpolation.3 There are references to “Yeshu’a of Nazareth” in the Talmud, but they are too late in date to be certainly more than counterechoes of Christian thought."
contents,,"The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are “synoptic”: their contents and episodes allow of being arranged in parallel columns and “viewed together.” "
akimbo,,"char, which in Old English was cerr, meaning ‘a turn, return’. akimbo [LME] You might think that the odd-looking word akimbo, ‘with hands on the hips and elbows turned outwards’, derives from some exotic language. "

incumbent,,"Or I did until the kids got older and I became the father of three adolescents and began to feel that it was incumbent upon me to give them some fatherly advice about how to claw their way up corporate ladders, succeed beyond their wildest dreams, and amass enormous fortunes (with which to take care of me in a luxurious fashion in my old age). "
brahmanic,,"In excuse, I quote that most brahmanic of the Boston Brahmins, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.: “He must be a poor creature who does not often repeat himself. "
prosaic,,My advice is more prosaic: “Know Economics.” 
wisenheimer,,"I started out, at the beginning of the 1970s, as a cub wisenheimer at the National Lampoon, making fun of everything. "
imbroglio,,"No matter what armed imbroglio, conflict, crisis, or catastrophe I was writing about, everybody was in it for something. "
Corniche,,"In 1975 and 1976 the center of Beirut—”The Paris of the Middle East,” with its cafés, nightclubs, luxury hotels, and beachfront Corniche—was reduced to rubble. "
runaway,,"True, the war led to runaway inflation, as wars do. "
cloys,,"Love lasts, lust cloys. "
propriety,,Lust subverts propriety. 
pillories,,"So the task I set myself is to clean off some of the mud, to rescue it from the echoing denunciations of old men of the deserts, to deliver it from the pallid and envious confessors of Rome and the disgust of the Renaissance, to destroy the stocks and pillories of the Puritans, to separate it from other things that we know drag it down (for we shall find that there are worse things than lust, things that make pure lust itself impure), and so to lift it from the category of sin to that of virtue.

backcloth,,But any attempt at understanding of our collective or individual predicaments must needs be spelt out against the backcloth of a vision of human history. 
inexorable,,"ing those who set themselves up as self-appointed prophets, in possession of a secret plan of history and hence of the key to the future, who endeavour to browbeat humanity into the acceptance of their own values and recipes for the future, and who do this in the name of a possibly benign and allegedly inexorable historical necessity. "
scant,,"some backcloth vision of history, and of the low esteem in which elaboration of global historical patterns is at present held, is a most paradoxical situation: the ideas of nineteenth-century philosophers of history such as Hegel, M a r x , Comte, or Spencer are treated with scant respect and yet are everywhere in use. "
presuppose,,"They do so because some at least of the later developments in human history seem to presuppose the earlier ones, and could not have preceded them. "
perpetuate,,"But the precise extent to which concepts help perpetuate a society, and the extent to which on the other hand its perpetuation depends   1•4"
engender,,"We understand a social order when we see it as one possible corollary of the basic factors which engender it, but also when we see how other options could have been engendered by that same set of elements. "
clerisy,,"Two specialisms in par- ticular become of paramount importance: the emergence of a specialized ruling class, and of a specialized clerisy (specialists in cognition, legitimation, salvation, ritual). "
prescriptive,,"Ancestors, or past institutional forms, perhaps in idealized versions, are held up as the moral norm, the prescriptive ideal. "
Lancashire,,"The notion of industrial society (sometimes, for brevity, Industria), is here used in a broad and generic sense, going far beyond nineteenth- century Lancashire and the dark satanic mills. "
humdrum,,"An equally valid specimen of legitimation is something as humdrum as a cinema usherette, who leads the ticket holder to his appointed place, and without whom audiences would be inconvenienced by chaos. "
underwritten,,"Legitimators are underwritten by a given power situation; but equally, the balance of power depends on the nature and size and position of groupings, which in turn are built up by the humble daily activities of the ushers and usherettes of each society, who lead men to their places. "
recapitulation,,"If one realizes, for instance, that the “supervenience” theory of mental activity is essentially a recapitulation of the paradox it addresses, mistaken for a kind of clarification, then there is no need to lay out at length every individual iteration of its futility. "
intelligible,,"And all of this required a certain period of time because I wasn’t merely storing information in my mind in a disordered aggregate, but instead was arranging my reflections in a particular intelligible order according to a grammar of logical continuities, reasoning upon my actions, employing concepts that I had to communicate to myself by way of signs—words, that is, indicating ideas in relation to one another—the whole process guided by my longing to understand as much as I could. "
considering,,"For, in taking my time, I was considering a course of action prospectively, weighing one desire and one rationale against another until I arrived at a decision. "

hyperbolic,,"We start by seeing Descartes trying to motivate his method of extreme doubt (also known as Cartesian doubt, or as he himself calls it, ""hyperbolic"", that is, excessive or exaggerated doubt). "
Cogito,,"For even if I can climb out of the seas of doubt onto the Cogito, I cannot climb out onto the nature of your mind. "

teeming,,"If you’re experienced in landscape painting, it means that you’ve visited the part of the room teeming with images of landscapes. "
ragtime,,Jazz musicians weren’t trying to influence the birth of rock any more than ragtime composers consciously tried to shape jazz. 
blasé,,"I’m almost twenty years older than Fabrice, and I took less willingly than he did to having to jump through hoops for twerps with three-day beards who could have been my sons, and who pulled blasé faces at everything we wrote. "
vicarious,,"A god who begets children with a mortal woman; a sage who bids men work no more, have no more courts, but look for the signs of the impending end of the world; a justice that accepts the innocent as a vicarious sacrifice; someone who orders his disciples to drink his blood; prayers for miraculous interventions; sins perpetrated against a god, atoned for by a god; fear of a beyond to which death is the portal; the form of the cross as a symbol in a time that no longer knows the function and the ignominy of the cross—how ghoulishly all this touches us, as if from the tomb of a primeval past! "
communal,,"Quite apart from any questions of faith, I believed that the goal of communal life was to discover yourself in discovering your partner, and to encourage your partner to do the same. "
yoke,,"Suddenly I grasped that it is up to us to choose between life and death, that life is Christ and that his yoke is light. "
neurotic,,"Both of us were afraid of life, and we were both terribly neurotic. "
austere,,"She lived in a beautiful apartment on Rue Vaneau in the building formerly occupied by André Gide, and something about her evoked the kind of studious, almost austere, aura that you associate with the Nouvelle Revue Française—for which Gide wrote—between the wars. "
lithe,,"At a time when it was less common than it is today, she was well versed in Oriental wisdom and practiced yoga—thanks to which, until an advanced age, she was lithe as a cat. "
Communion,,"As a child I went to Sunday school and took my first Communion, but this Christian education was so formal, so routine, that it wouldn’t make sense to say that I lost my faith at any given moment. "
edifying,,This edifying tale so frightened him that he prayed each night that he be spared from receiving God’s grace and becoming a priest. 
claptrap,,"The only things he really cares about in life are of a—again I trip over this terrible word, with everything it entails in the form of pious inanity and otherworldly claptrap, but there you go—“spiritual” nature. "
torpor,,"I emerged from this depressive torpor only to brood over my misery, once again torn between the clear fact that Anne and I were unhappy together and the conviction that I had made my choice and that for me success depended on how well I could stick to it. "
Dare,,Dare to knock.” 
injunction,,"Peter swears he does, and Jesus asks him to feed his sheep—an injunction that leaves me somewhat cold because I’m not a shepherd by vocation. "
bigotry,,"Unlike me, she grew up in a family that was Catholic to the point of bigotry. "
scruples,,"She inherited the whole package of religious neuroses: an abhorrence of sex, agonizing scruples, overarching sadness. "

groggy,,"Long, groggy spans punctuated by masturbation. "
vocative,,"This book, which foreshadowed Montaigne and Rousseau—and the first in which someone struggles to come to terms with who he has been, what has made him himself and no one else—is entirely written in the vocative. "
Sulpician,,"Left to myself I would have been more inclined to read Teresa of Ávila, whom I see as the height of mystical chic, while Thérèse of Lisieux reminds me of my parents-in-law’s stodgy piousness, and everything covered by the adjective “Sulpician.” "
Are,,Are you denying your own existence now? 
sophists,,"When sophists do that, I usually take them at their word and stop arguing with them. "
interleaves,,"For instance, the movie Sliding Doors interleaves two variants of a love story, following the fortunes of two instances of the same couple in two universes which initially differ only in one small detail. "
hull,,So there must be a separate floor and walls as well as an entire spaceship hull in the phantom zone. 
receptacle,,This is to stress that a universe is not a receptacle containing physical objects: it is those objects. 
dwindle,,"ABOUT THE BOOK   In a near-future France, François, a middle-aged academic, is watching his life slowly dwindle to nothing. "
Proteus,,"So it goes, in the remaining Western social democracies, when you finish your studies, but most students don’t notice right away because they’re hypnotised by the desire for money or, if they’re more primitive, the desire for consumer goods (though these cases of acute product-addiction are unusual: the mature, thoughtful majority develop a fascination with that ‘tireless Proteus’, money itself).

plaintive,,"He lets the reader stay one step ahead of him, inviting us to laugh at him, and his overly plaintive, awful or ludicrous descriptions, even before he laughs at himself. "
I'd,,"Nights were spent at one person’s place or the other’s (in fact, I’d usually stay at theirs, since the grim, not to say insalubrious, atmosphere at mine hardly lent itself to romantic interludes); sexual acts took place (to what I like to think was our mutual satisfaction). "

vagabondage,,"The way things were supposed to work (and I have no reason to think much has changed), young people, after a brief period of sexual vagabondage in their very early teens, were expected to settle down in exclusive, strictly monogamous relationships involving activities (outings, weekends, holidays) that were not only sexual, but social. "
like,,"Relationships of variable duration (a year being, according to my own observations, an acceptable amount of time) and of variable number (an average of ten to twenty might be considered a reasonable estimate) were supposed to succeed one another until they ended, like an apotheosis, with the last relationship, this one conjugal and final, which would lead, via the begetting of children, to the formation of a family. "

"
tactless,,"For reasons I didn’t entirely understand, it suddenly seemed tactless, almost unthinkable, to talk about the old days. "
wringer,,"From the sour and bitter way she talked about her male colleagues (in the end we’d been reduced to discussing her professional life: she was head of communications for an association of Bordeaux winemakers, so she travelled a lot to promote French wines, mostly in Asia) it was painfully clear that she had been through the wringer. "
entrenched,,"At the dawn of the twentieth century, classical mechanics was firmly entrenched. "
inextricably,,"And I believe that we can achieve the greatest understanding if we consider them not singly but jointly, for they are inextricably related. "

Technicolor,,"Whether or not it’s the cause, I blame my very first time at fourteen years old in Evan Keller’s basement for imprinting me with a fixed map of arousal—my memory of the event still flows through my mind in animated Technicolor. "
hymen,,"Afterward I’d gone to the bathroom and then called him in; with an expression of melancholy curiosity, as though transfixed at an aquarium, he’d watched the ruins of my hymen drifting in the blue toilet bowl water like it was the last remaining survivor of a once-plentiful species. "
fervent,,"At university I began throwing myself into classics studies, finding brief solace from my sexual frustrations in texts depicting ancient battles of fervent bloodshed. "
waltz,,"Perhaps I’d even get to waltz with one or two of the more outgoing male students under the guise of fun and frivolity—the boys who would confidently grab my hand and lead me to the center of the floor, not realizing until our bodies were pressed that they could smell the pulsing, fragrant wetness just one layer of fabric away beneath my dress.

SOE,,"In such a case, the government may set up an SOE and run it as if it is not a monopoly. "
suave,,"If you want to see it in action, watch the BBC TV classic Yes, Minister and its sequel, Yes, Prime Minister, with the legendary South African actor Nigel Hawthorn (of The Madness of King George fame) playing the suave and devious mandarin Sir Humphrey Appleby. "
dollop,,"He offered an explanation, speaking of his search for tiny pores in the skin of reality, like the holes that worms bore into wood, and how upon finding one he was able to expand and stretch it the way a glassblower turns a dollop of molten glass into a long-necked pipe, and how he then allowed time to flow like water at one mouth while causing it to thicken like syrup at the other. "
emergent,,"We sometimes say that the “microscopic” or “fundamental” dynamics are reversible, but the “macroscopic” or “emergent” dynamics aren’t. "
Samarkand,,"Into his chosen imperial capital at Samarkand, close to his birthplace, he poured the booty of his conquests, and there he fashioned the architectural monuments that proclaimed the splendour of his reign. "
sown,,"As he himself may have grasped intuitively, it was no longer possible to rule the sown from the steppe and build a Eurasian empire on the old foundations of Mongol military power. "
astride,,"Notions of universal empire, a new ‘culture of travel’, and millenarian rumours and fantasies circulated around the huge land mass between Spain and the Bay of Bengal.11 Geographical location in Asia or Europe begins to look much less important for social and cultural change than a position astride Eurasia’s trunk lines of trade, or in the arid belt where long-distance travellers did not have to toil through forest, jungle or marsh.12 A similar change of emphasis can be seen among historians writing the new ‘global history of material progress’. "
facile,,"As van Leur had suggested, the facile conclusion that Europeans had galvanized a somnolent Asia after Vasco da Gama’s arrival in India in 1498 was a travesty of the facts. "
somnolent,,"As van Leur had suggested, the facile conclusion that Europeans had galvanized a somnolent Asia after Vasco da Gama’s arrival in India in 1498 was a travesty of the facts. "
myopic,,"It treats ‘colonial’ history as myopic and biased, perhaps even delusory, and its claims as so much propaganda aimed at opinion at home. "
gambit,,"k a bargain with Brahmins to harden caste status into an administrative system (formalized in the census).16 In colonial Africa a parallel process took place as clans and followings were reinvented as ‘tribes’, with chiefly rulers as their ancestral leaders.17 Here, as in India, a political gambit was carefully packaged as an act of respect to local tradition. "
astride,,"It meant the control of key zones astride the maritime highways that ran between Europe and the rest of the world: the classic case was Egypt, occupied by Britain in 1882. "
sepoy,,"Once their Raj was in place, the British taxed Indians to pay for the military power – a sepoy army – that they needed in Asia. "
gaunt,,The gaunt freezing works with their grimy smokestacks that sprang up round the coasts of New Zealand after 1880 were the industrial face of colonization. 
smokestacks,,The gaunt freezing works with their grimy smokestacks that sprang up round the coasts of New Zealand after 1880 were the industrial face of colonization. 
homology,,"The answer is that there is a fundamental homology between the interpretative procedure of Marx and Freud – more precisely, between their analysis of commodity and of dreams. "
retinue,,"What we have inferred so far is only that each tangible photon has an accompanying retinue of shadow photons, and that when a photon passes through one of our four slits, some shadow photons pass through the other three slits. "
solipsism,,A bad explanation (such as solipsism) may be true. 
ontic,,"11) Spending energy on the difference between ontic and epistemic randomness—true randomness, and randomness that arises from incomplete information—instead of focusing on the more consequential difference between Mediocristan and Extremistan. "
engender,,"Imagine now that the same mathematics could prove that, given similar conditions, consumers and producers who maximise utility or profit in a free market environment unconsciously engender a social reality which is the best society could hope for (given its resources and private preferences). "
conceits,,These are but vain conceits and frivolous objections against the power of Eros. 
frivolous,,These are but vain conceits and frivolous objections against the power of Eros. 
raconteuses,,"Fiammetta herself seems to have died in the plague, and Boccaccio was calm enough to use the name that he had given her for one of the least finicky raconteuses of his book. "
bubonic,,"succession of famine years in western Europe—1333–4, 1337–42, 1345–7—probably sapped the resistance of the poor, who then communicated the disease to all classes.39 It took two forms: pulmonary, with high fever and spitting of blood, bringing death in three days; or bubonic, with fever, abscesses, and carbuncles, leading to death in five days. "
carbuncles,,"n Europe—1333–4, 1337–42, 1345–7—probably sapped the resistance of the poor, who then communicated the disease to all classes.39 It took two forms: pulmonary, with high fever and spitting of blood, bringing death in three days; or bubonic, with fever, abscesses, and carbuncles, leading to death in five days. "
recourse,,"The common people, being altogether untended and unsuccored, sickened by the thousand daily, and died well nigh without recourse. "
imperil,,"The neighbors, moved more by fear lest the corruption of the dead bodies should imperil themselves than by any charity for the departed… brought the bodies forth from the houses and laid them before the doors, where, especially in the morning, those who went about might see corpses without number. "
reckoned,,The thing was come to such a pass that folk reckoned no more of men that died than nowadays they would of goats.43   Out of this scene of desolation Boccaccio pictures his Decameron as taki
timorous,,"44 The suggestion is accepted, but Filomena improves upon it: since “we women are fickle, willful, suspicious, and timorous,” it might be well to have some men in the party. "
sturdy,,"Bruce, a sturdy fellow with thick glasses and a sharp but practical mind, and I were sitting outside a coffee shop on Castro St. "
quaint,,"This street, which sits in the center of Mountain View, a quaint little town at the bottom of San Francisco Bay, has a European flavor but with the added benefit of California sunshine. "
lateral,,"He referred to the whole thing as “a lateral arrangement of worlds, a plurality of overlapping Earths along whose linking axis a person can somehow move.” "
preoccupation,,"At no time did I have a theoretical or conscious explanation for my preoccupation with these pluriform pseudo worlds, but now I think I understand. "
Lest,,"Now, the King James Bible says: “The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together…” Lest you think it’s an issue with the one translation, there are other versions, such as the New American Standalone Bible, that say something similar: “And the wolf will dwell with the lamb …”21 Another famous one is the Lord’s Prayer, which even non-Christians h"
preclude,,"I would argue that the weirdness of quantum mechanics doesn’t preclude multiple possible pasts, just as it doesn’t preclude multiple possible presents or multiple possible futures. "
pastiche,,The prevailing secular worldview is a pastiche of current scientific orthodoxy and pious hopes. 
subversive,,"Today this is a subversive truth, for it entails the vanity of politics. "
expedients,,"However radical, political programmes are expedients – modest devices for coping with recurring evils. "
oblations,,"These oblations will take the worshipper 6 On the sun’s rays to the world of Brahma, Where he can have his fill of enjoyment. "

rapacious,,It is a consequence of the evolutionary success of an exceptionally rapacious primate. 
afoot,,The scale of the change afoot cannot be known with certainty. 
matter,,"Finally, as a matter of convention, we refer to the first player as a man and the second player as a woman; this will allow us to utilize pronouns like “he” and “she” instead of endlessly repeating “player 1” and “player 2.” "
conceit,,"To instrumentalists, the idea that science can enable us to understand the underlying reality that accounts for our observations is a fallacy and a conceit. "
stifled,,Is anyone worried that creativity may be stifled as a result of such exercise? 
prosody,,"On the other hand, we who did not enjoy such early experiences with meter and rhyme have to study prosody as though it were a foreign language. "
snippet,,"not that heavy, but different, ""My little horse must think it queer"" is not a very rattling line, but the sound of ""think,"" with its lightly snapping k this time followed not by a softer sound but by the snippet ""it,"" and ""queer,"" an echo of the k, makes it altogether livelier than the first stanza. "
chasm,,"After ""lake"" there is a momentary chasm, a fracture of silence out of which a different kind of elec-tricity flows before the line swings and the adjective ""darkest"" repeats the k once more, two taps of disqui-etude.   "
gravel,,"Or these, by Robert Frost:     I saw you from that very window there, Making the gravel leap and leap in air,   Leap up, Jike that, like that, and land so lightly And roll back down the mound beside the hole.   "
mound,,"  I saw you from that very window there, Making the gravel leap and leap in air,   Leap up, Jike that, like that, and land so lightly And roll back down the mound beside the hole.   "

hobbled,,"Home he hobbled, not caring, with a stick whip-ping goldenrod.   "
Runic,,"Here are just four lines:   Keeping time, time, time,   In a sort of Runic rhyme,   To the tintinnabulation* that so musically wells From the bells, bells, bells, bells, . . .  "
belched,,"Here are two more examples, both from poems by Robert Penn Warren:   ""We took the big bellied gun that belched. "
impelled,,You are impelled to cast your net wider in your search for a successful schema. 
presumably,,"(In the example, a schema that makes predictions contradicted by the succeeding images is presumably discarded by the subject, while one that gives correct predictions is retained and assigned a high value. "
fortuitous,,"Prediction becomes impossible, and we have the fortuitous phenomenon. "
marionettes,,"The leaders of Parallel Action, whom Musil depicts as so many ridiculous marionettes, are thus all in search of a “redemptive idea,” which they evoke endlessly yet in the vaguest of terms—for indeed, they have neither the slightest inkling of what the idea might be nor how it might perform its redemptive function beyond their country’s borders. "
garrison,,"As a military officer, he is used to being in a position of dominance, yet here he finds himself confronted with a form of knowledge that offers him no landmarks, nothing to hold on to: “We marched down the ranks in that colossal store house of books, and I don’t mind telling you I was not particularly overwhelmed; those rows of books are not particularly worse than a garrison on parade. "
quibble,,"You could quibble with the librarian’s claim not to read any books, since he takes a close interest in the books about books known as catalogs. "
lacuna,,"My intellectual library, like every library, is composed of gaps and blanks, but in reality this presents no real problem: it is sufficiently well stocked for any particular lacuna to be all but invisible. "
Ibid,,"Ibid., pp. "
par excellence,,"Monsieur Teste, the Valéryan hero par excellence, lives in an apartment empty of books. "
forfeited,,"They who have taught us so much, who seem to have bowed out for our sake and forfeited to us their advantages, ought by all rights to be reverently summoned to our memories and invited to drink a draught of life through our words.9 If he had hoped to live on in the thoughts of others, Anatole France would have done well to find some other eulogizer than Valéry, who employ"

Melanesia,,"Settlement of the Indo-Pacific archipelagos soon followed, with the ancestors of the Austronesian-speaking peoples setting out from the Fujian coast of China around 7000 B.C. to settle Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and onward to Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. "
Micronesia,,"Settlement of the Indo-Pacific archipelagos soon followed, with the ancestors of the Austronesian-speaking peoples setting out from the Fujian coast of China around 7000 B.C. to settle Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and onward to Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. "

jingoistic,,"Encouraged by a jingoistic press, Americans increasingly took an interest in the efforts of Cubans to free themselves from Spanish colonial rule. "
conceded,,"With some reluctance, and subject to numerous conditions, the United States conceded Cuban independence but decided to retain control of the Philippines and there became embroiled in an insurrection with its former allies, the local insurgents under Emilio Aguinaldo. "
Whitneys,,"Equally disturbing was the growing gap between rich and poor, a trend exemplified by the rise of industrial elites such as the Rockefellers, Carnegies, Morgans, and Whitneys and masses of impoverished, slum-dwelling workers. "
muckrakers,,"Much of this rising concern and demand for reform was generated by the writings of investigative journalists, or “muckrakers,” who penned exposes of corporate and political wrongdoing. "
undercut,,Reforms of municipal government saw the adoption of measures designed to undercut the power of corrupt political machines. 
Entente,,"The War in Europe When World War I broke out in Europe in the summer of 1914, America declared its neutrality, a position Wilson hoped would allow the U.S. to play the role of peacemaker between the Triple Entente (England, France, and Russia) and the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary).

inexorably,,"After nearly a decade of overheated economic growth, excessive borrowing, and widespread crisis among farmers, the economy slowly but inexorably collapsed. "
embargo,,Economic Crisis The oil embargo and ensuing inflation were not the only troubling economic developments. 
stymied,,"Conservative opposition to the amendment, however, successfully stymied any additional ratifications. "
cronyism,,The federal government’s late and weak response to this tragedy was seen as an example of the results of cronyism and lack of planning in the Administration. 
precipitous,,"In addition, the dismal management performance of the leading American carmakers and the precipitous decline in auto sales put GM, Ford, and Chrysler on the edge of bankruptcy. "
temerity,,"To them, I can only say that I am wholly conscious of the pitfalls, but still feel that, unless we are quite sure that there could never be an overall pattern to be discerned, we are obliged, in full knowledge of the temerity of the undertaking, to make the attempt. "
proscribed,,"Similarly, some of the developments in the West have parallels elsewhere: with regard to the Reformation, one could point to other times and places in which the visual image was proscribed, and where there was a text-based, black-and-white, intolerant fundamentalism, at odds with any richer understanding of myth and metaphor: such tendencies form an important part of the history of some other religions, including Islam. "
rectilinear,,"But there is nothing like the extraordinary divarication of culture that seems to have characterised the history of the West – no equivalent of the Enlightenment, with its insistence on just one, rectilinear, way of conceiving the world, and (because there was no need for it) no Romanticism that aimed to redress it. "

"
anomalous,,This form of scientific development is exceptional and anomalous.5 WHY HAVE THE SHIFTS OF BALANCE OCCURRED? 
prerogative,,Fine-grained analysis is the expert's prerogative. 
posit,,One does not need to posit drives that are instantiated in the hemispheres. 
invariably,,"However, we are now turning to look at the ‘battle of the hemispheres’, as one might call it, over long periods of history, often, though not invariably, longer than the lifetime of any one brain. "
slugging,,"It may seem that I am suggesting that there is some cosmic struggle going on behind the scenes here, with the left and right hemispheres slugging it out on a grand scale. "
imputing,,"Without imputing drives to the hemispheres, one can see that each hemispheric world is complemented by the other, and in a situation where one predominates, the lack of the other will become increasingly apparent. "
phenomenological,,"Genetic shifts might also explain the extraordinary decline which followed the overrunning of the Roman Empire by Goths, Huns and Franks in the fourth and fifth centuries AD, since, however much one may admire aspects of life in what used to be called the Dark Ages, effectively whole ways of thinking and being, whole aspects of the phenomenological world, simply disappeared in the West for nearly a thousand years. "
underwrites,,"(This is a bit like the way in which the structure of a neuronal connection in the brain changes with use, so as to promote preferential use of the same connection in future, part of a process of ‘solidification’ of mind by brain which underwrites the phenomenon of memory.) "
shoddy,,"The machinery makes a mistake or is handed shoddy materials, but, as long as it remains in this story, it remains a machine. "
simile,,"Thus writing of the difference between the earliest humans and homo sapiens, Steven Mithen writes: ‘We might characterise Early Humans as having a capacity for simile – they could be “like” an animal – but not for metaphor – they could not “become” an animal’.24 What he is getting at here is empathic identification. "
metaphor,,"Thus writing of the difference between the earliest humans and homo sapiens, Steven Mithen writes: ‘We might characterise Early Humans as having a capacity for simile – they could be “like” an animal – but not for metaphor – they could not “become” an animal’.24 What he is getting at here is empathic identification. "
Charlemagne,,"But we need not doubt that he confounded himself mythically with Alexander at the time of his expedition to the East, and later when he had decided on an empire in the West, he declared, ‘I am Charlemagne’. "
boozer,,"“Our mom was a—well, a boozer, frankly. "
prying,,"What was far more likely, if one assumed a four-year-old didn’t suddenly decide to leave home on her own in the middle of the night, was that the abductor entered the apartment through the front door, without picking the lock or prying the hinges loose from the jamb, because such actions were unnecessary on a door that had been left unlocked. "
niece,,"I told her I didn’t think there was much we could do that a hundred cops, half the Boston press corps, and thousands of everyday people weren’t already doing on her niece’s behalf. "
imputing,,"8 Metonymy In the cases of personification that we have looked at we are imputing human qualities to things that are not human—theories, diseases, inflation, etc. "
raves,,He constantly raves about her. 
fend,,He has to fend them off. 
epistolary,,"The details of the rest of his life are similarly obscure, and the few details we know for certain are inferred from his writings, particularly his correspondence with his friend Pliny the Younger, the politician and famous epistolary writer. "
strife,,"The despotisms of Cinna and Sulla were brief; the rule of Pompeius and of Crassus soon yielded before Cæsar; the arms of Lepidus and Antonius before Augustus; who, when the world was wearied by civil strife, subjected it to empire under the title of “Prince.”"
Commonwealth,,"When after the destruction of Brutus and Cassius there was no longer any army of the Commonwealth, when Pompeius was crushed in Sicily, and when, with Lepidus pushed aside and Antonius slain, even the Julian faction had only Cæsar left to lead it, then, dropping the title of triumvir, and giving out that he was a consul, and was satisfied with a tribune’s authority for the protection of the people, Augustus won over the soldiers with gifts, the populace with cheap corn, and all men with the sweets of repose, and so grew greater by degrees, while he concentrated in himself the"
proscription,,"He was wholly unopposed, for the boldest spirits had fallen in battle, or in the proscription, while the remaining nobles, the readier they were to be slaves, were raised the higher by wealth and promotion, so that, aggrandised by revolution, they preferred the safety of the present to the dangerous past. "
aggrandised,,"He was wholly unopposed, for the boldest spirits had fallen in battle, or in the proscription, while the remaining nobles, the readier they were to be slaves, were raised the higher by wealth and promotion, so that, aggrandised by revolution, they preferred the safety of the present to the dangerous past. "
Peripatetic,,"Most of the many rhetorical handbooks produced by Aristotle’s Peripatetic School are now lost, but its teachings were to be influential in Rome; also in circulation were the ideas of the Stoic School, which taught a brief and austere style of speech. "
convulsions,,"After his murder during the convulsions that followed the assassination of Julius Caesar, Cicero’s oratory was to achieve iconic status. "

occluded,,"The winter (northeast) monsoon lasts from October to March and is characterized by cool, dry air.   occluded front when a cold front overtakes a warm front, the denser cold air flows under the less dense warm air.   prevailing winds throughout the world, winds follow regular patterns. "
doldrums,,"In some places winds are so light and infrequent as to scarcely exist, such as in the doldrums along the equator and in the horse latitudes near latitude 30° N and S. "
leeward,,In other places the winds tend to come from a particular direction and are called prevailing winds.   rain shadow an area on the leeward side of a mountain range that receives little rainfall.   relative humidity the amount of moisture (water vapor) in the air compared with the total amount it can hold expressed as a percent. 
mistral,,"th wind of southeastern Australia; buran, a cold, violent north/northeast wind of Siberia and Central Asia, common in winter; chinook, a dry winter or spring wind which blows down the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains often warm enough to melt the snow; harmattan, a hot, dry north wind in West Africa which cools as it evaporates the moist air of the coast; mistral, a cold, strong north/northwest wind of the western Mediterranean with a surface strength of 60 km/hour, frequent in winter; pampero, a sudden, cold south or west wind in Argentina and Uruguay frequent in summer; Santa Ana a hot, dry wind that blows from the north or east in Southern California; sirocco, a hot south wind of North Africa and southern Italy;"
chagrin,,"For example, if you have an anecdote that got you some laughs at parties lately, you are likely to remember that story in other social occasions and might tell it again (to the chagrin of your partner attending these events with you). "
voilà,,"Then, I know that our spines don’t reach all the way from the top of our head down to our ankles, so I subtract around 3 feet for the legs and half a foot or so for the head, and voilà, I arrive at a guess of just over 2 feet for the spine. "
port,,He was also capable of drinking prodigious quantities of port. 
Jaffa,,Even whether I buy Jaffa Cakes or chocolate digestives to eat with my tea. 
faffing,,"You might well want to change them for other reasons, but faffing around with taxes on tobacco or inheritances or capital gains will never raise enough money to make a real difference to the size or scope of the state. "
retribution,,"Rather than attempting any of the more modern aims of the law, such as rehabilitation, Hammurabi’s Code mandated simple retribution. "
proclivity,,The Roman historian Plutarch suggested that Solon intentionally wrote laws with a measure of ambiguity in order to increase the power of the courts through interpretation—a step that foreshadowed the U.S. lawmakers’ proclivity to let the courts decide the application of the general provisions of statutes to specific situations. 
usurpation,,"Law was made more sophisticated as a method of stabilizing society by Lucius Cornelius Sulla (138–78 B.C.), a Roman general and dictator whose usurpation of power paved the way for the fall of the republic. "
incursions,,"For example, Sulla protected the power of the Senate from populist incursions by giving it control of the courts and new measures against the tribunes. "
presumption,,"Augustus established legal principles that would influence Western law, including clear procedures for formalizing contracts, strengthening personal property law, and the presumption that defendants were innocent until proven guilty. "
disparate,,Previously disparate Roman legal decisions and laws were now systematized and codified as the Corpus Juris Civilis (body of civil law).

spawned,,His work spawned responses and critiques from many different political positions.

Forlorn,,Forlorn! 
squalor,,"The most unequal countries have tended to underinvest in public services, a phenomenon that economist John Kenneth Galbraith once called ‘private opulence and public squalor’.24 In Rio de Janeiro, crime-stricken favelas can easily be seen from the luxury hotels that line Ipanema beach. "

Sudetenland,,The 1938 Munich Agreement allowed Germany to annexe the Sudetenland. 
wellspring,,"Observing children engaged in imaginative play reveals a wellspring of natural-born creativity; they make up and act out stories, taking on the roles of writer, actor, and director with ease and enjoyment. "
scald,,"Others are occupied with what to do about the tea: you wouldn’t want to burn your own hand, but neither would you want to scald someone else. "
dispositions,,"Instead, it is an immense society of hard-earned practical ideas—of multitudes of life-learned rules and exceptions, dispositions and tendencies, balances and checks. "
bushel,,"Much as it must pain any scholar and publisher of integrity to abridge such a work (for such an act does resemble the dissection of a body), one must not, as Jesus told us, light a candle and then place it invisibly under a bushel (Matthew 5:14–17). "
ostentatious,,The greatness of On Growth and Form lies in its genuine integration (not just ostentatious show) of these three foci.

yanking,,"When governments of emerging markets complained that foreign investors were fearfully yanking capital from their markets during the Asian financial crisis of 1997, liberal democrats in the West told them that this was the way free markets worked. "
desiderata,,"Laplace, 1819 We have now formulated our problem, and it is a matter of straightforward mathematics to work out the consequences of our desiderata, which may be stated broadly as follows:   (I)  Representation of degrees of plausibility by real numbers;  (II)  Qualitative correspondence with common sense; (III)  Consistency. "
insolvency,,"allooning of the financial sector; that sector’s capture of the regulatory system; ceaseless stimulus whenever the economy has wavered; taxpayer-funded bailouts of large capitalist corporations; crony capitalism; private profits and public losses; the redemption of the rich and powerful by the poor and weak; companies that shorted stock for a living being legally protected from the shorting of their own stock; compromised yet unpunished ratings agencies; government policies that tried to cure insolvency by branding it as illiquidity; and, on the quantitative side, the widespread use of obviously poor quantitative security valuation models for the purpose of marketing. "
divination,,"Deep inside, everyone recognizes that the purpose of building models and creating theories is divination: foretelling the future, and controlling it. "
crackpots,,"In physics it’s fairly easy to tell the crackpots from the experts by the content of their writings, without having to know their academic pedigrees. "
whence,,Yet few people have the practical experience to understand those limits or whence they originate. 
invariant,,"Theories and models are attempts to eliminate time and its consequences, to make the world invariant, so that present and future become one. "
flagrantly,,"Next came the Immorality Act of 1950, which prohibited not just marriage but also adultery, attempted adultery, and other “immoral” acts between whites and blacks, thereby trying to deny, annul, or undo 300 years of the miscegenation that was flagrantly visible. "
miscegenation,,"Given South Africa’s history of miscegenation, it was not uncommon for members of the same family to end up with different chromatography profiles. "
delicto,,"The air you breathe, once you grow accustomed to it, has no smell at all.2 When I was ten years old our neighbor down the block, a Jewish businessman in his forties with two sons a little older than I, was found on the floor of his downtown office in flagrante delicto with a young black girl.

subversive,,The South African prism had shifted the political spectrum so far to the dictatorial right that Ayn Rand’s defense of the individual and of libertarian capitalism seemed to me and my friends to be subversive. 
indignant,,"As young white teenagers in the 1950s, we spent the entire summer in the sun on Fourth Beach at Clifton or in the crowded Snake Pit at Muizenberg, applying fish oil or Skol so as to get as dark as possible.3 A girl I knew who devoted her time to acquiring a magnificent tan grew indignant when the train conductor mistook her for a Coloured and instructed her to go to the train carriage reserved for that race.

infirmity,,"There are only humans, driven by conflicting needs and illusions, and subject to every kind of infirmity of will and judgement. "
ceding,,By ceding so much control over new technology to the marketplace they have colluded in their own powerlessness.

Fabian,,"The Fabian Society in England, founded in 1883, argued that all the programs for changing society were in place and would eventually bring about harmonious relations between workers and capitalists. "
phenomenology,,"To demonstrate as much, the author offers a kind of phenomenology of true love —including sexual love— and tracks down, in their many forms, the threats it faces. "
foundering,,"Love, the claim goes, is foundering because of endless freedom of choice, the overabundance of options, and the compulsion for perfection. "
obverse,,"Ironically, on the obverse side is the image of George Washington, the only one of our first four presidents not to read Latin. "
inconstancy,,", and flighty.13 They knew that the Greek historian Polybius had criticized the people of Athens for being like a ship without a commander.14 “The history of Athens abounds with instances of the levity and inconstancy of that unsteady people,” Edward Wortley Montagu warned in 1759.15 By contrast, John Dickinson, in his influential pre-Revolutionary Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, called the Spartans “as brave and as free a people as ever existed.”"
lodestar,,"26 It was not just their core narrative, it was their lodestar. "
magnolias,,"On this last, it is vital to remember that, despite the Southern images of moonlight and magnolias, of gracious living and mint juleps on the porch, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison all came from what the historian Annette Gordon-Reed calls “a society built on and sustained by violence, actual and threatened.”"
chattel,,"45 Because the founders failed to find a way to address the entire issue of race-based chattel slavery, less than a century later the nation they built would fracture into civil war and undergo a long and halting reconstruction that continues even today."
blatantly,,"trained for it, it’s an incredibly effective general compression algorithm.9 In theory, with the right data, it could perform any task.10 It is also blatantly subhuman in other domains: the sheer number of examples it needs to permanently learn new skills, its failure at precise symbol manipulation tasks, and its lack of certain kinds of common sense, episodic memory, and ability to seek out new evidence and be corrected.12 People who work with it know to constantly doubt its output. "
subvert,,"29 Some activists, anticipating disaster, have called for a ban on systems more powerful than the current version.30 The thing can be made to subvert its intensive ethics training just by talking to it funny.31 One version wasn’t trained properly and, as a result, tried to get a journalist to leave his wife and threatened a professor for writing about its bizarre behavior.32 It was quickly patched, but the patc"
empirical,,Trenton Bricken That would be an empirical question. 
newfangled,,What are these newfangled things? 
preoccupy,,"Rather than focusing on subjects that preoccupy me, I’ve learned to simply let myself be filled with them. "
rebar,,"The network of roots formed a structure that retained the soil and the rocks, like rebar in reinforced concrete, creating a composite structure with incredible strength. "
doesn't,,"This result tends to arise from a combination of using a generic utility function that doesn't quite match a person's true utility at extremes of wealth, with setups that tend to exploit those extremes, such as having an infinitesimal probability of making more than all the money in the world or losing everything. "
culled,,The masterpiece—a cure—resulted from the patient's will combined with the physician's intuition and skill in using remedies culled from millennia of observant trial and error. 
interred,,Part 1 Growth and Regrowth Salamander: energy's seed sleeping interred in the marrow . . . 
cajoling,,"Likewise, there appears to be one fundamental force that heals, although the myriad schools of medicine all have their favorite ways of cajoling it into action. "
presumptuous,,"Whether or not we believe in the literal truth of these particular accounts, over the years so many otherwise reliable witnesses have testified to healing ""miracles"" that it seems presumptuous to dismiss them all as fabrications. "
bequests,,"Accordingly, in Section II we focus on the utility of lifetime spending, inclusive of philanthropy and bequests, as the primary lodestar for evaluating core financial decisions."
presumption,,"Although the teapot may never be observed, it is an “intolerable presumption,” says Russell, on the part of the human race to doubt its existence. "
forestall,,"To forestall this possibility, these societies resort to collective methods of inflicting death such as communal stoning, precipitation from a cliff, or crucifixion, thus inviting unanimous participation. "
recourse,,Brutus sees the death of Caesar as an exceptional sacrifice made necessary by circumstances so critical that all political and legal recourse has become impossible. 
redress,,He does not want the murder to appear as the furtive and illegal deed of a few disgruntled politicians: What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress? 
chide,,"sh fit for the gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds; And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, Stir up their servants to an act of rage, And after seem to chide ’em. "
perverse,,"To call Hamlet a nostalgic play or a play preoccupied by the past may seem perverse, given the many, many ways it has seemed to capture Shakespeare at his most modern. "
onomastic,,"In many ways Hamlet’s closest canonical neighbour is not the later tragedies of Othello and Macbeth but the earlier 1 Henry IV, another story of a prince trying to escape the burden of a father with whom he shares the same name (and we can see that that play goes to considerable onomastic lengths to hide the fact that the prince – variously dubbed Hal or Harry – is, like his father, ‘Henry’, a name he can only really inherit, like the crown itself, on the death of his father). "
Shakespeare,,"Shakespeare’s history plays interweave patrilineal and fraternal rivalries within the family and state, marginalizing women and rehearsing versions of regime change. "
patrilineal,,"Shakespeare’s history plays interweave patrilineal and fraternal rivalries within the family and state, marginalizing women and rehearsing versions of regime change. "
hobbles,,"Hamlet’s name connects him to the past: it hobbles him from moving forwards and condemns him to a life shaped by verbs prefixed by ‘re-’: remembering, revenging, repeating. "
sidelong,,"As with the blurred skull in Hans Holbein’s anamorphic sixteenth-century painting The Ambassadors, a sidelong look at Twelfth Night brings the play’s themes into three-dimensional focus. "
ostensibly,,"Olivia disdains him, ostensibly because she is in extended mourning for her dead father and brother. "
epiphenomenon,,"PRESENTISM, ETERNALISM, POSSIBILISM We’ve painted a picture in which the arrow of time isn’t built into the fundamental laws of physics but is an epiphenomenon—a by-product of the fact that the universe started in a condition of low entropy, and that low-entropy states tend to evolve into increasingly higher-entropy ones. "
harken,,"And the best way to do that is to harken back, once again, to how we think about space. "
bourgeoisie,,"The undisguised self-interest of the Prussian government, the implacable resistance of the German bourgeoisie toward anything that might alleviate the condition of the German working classes, the almost caricaturesque attitudes of reaction which characterized the wealthy and ruling classes of Europe—all of this had coalesced in his mind to form part of a new philosophy of history. "
impetus,,"For example, the isolated markets of the Middle Ages began to lock fingers under the impetus of exploration and political unification, and a new commercial world was born. "
shrew,,"The vertices correspond to archetypal life-strategies denoted shrew (S), whale (W), and bat (B). "
libel,,Other accusations were outright defamatory and would have exposed the publisher to charges of libel. 
see,,"At the beginning of his career, however, Wittgenstein seemed close to the logicist position of Bertrand Russell (see my epilogue), as opposed to the preoccupations of Philosophical Investigations. "
preoccupations,,"At the beginning of his career, however, Wittgenstein seemed close to the logicist position of Bertrand Russell (see my epilogue), as opposed to the preoccupations of Philosophical Investigations. "
ligature,,"His grandson, George, would throughout his life maintain the ligature between the o and the e in Cœdès, as well as on the accent grave on the second e. "
eschewed,,"Raised in comfort in Paris, George eschewed a career in finance, a field his father had encouraged him to study, and decided instead to learn languages. "
Khmer,,"Over the next few months until his discharge from military service, Cœdès spent every minute he could spare in some Parisian museum, armed with notebook and pen, copying writings in Old Khmer, the ancient Cambodian language that fascinated him the most. "
primacy,,"He had even used the discoveries of ancient Greek coins in India—proving Indian trade with Greece—to bolster his claims of European primacy, and his main issue for decades had been to oppose the idea that the nine numerals with a zero were invented in India. "
friezes,,"While it has no sexually explicit imagery, per se, Angkor Wat is adorned by thousands of alluring seminude female friezes of demigoddesses, or nymphs, called Apsara. "
lintels,,"These temples are now in ruins, but the kind of art found here—as evidenced in carved decorations of lintels and doorways, using small friezes and geometrical designs—is discussed as the unique “Sambor on Mekong” style of art. "
apogee,,"Here the resemblance to the Nazis comes in: Between 1974 and 1979—the apogee of its rule—the Khmer Rouge tortured thousands of their fellow Cambodians and killed a quarter of the country’s population (it has been estimated that between 1.7 and 2 million people died in the infamous Killing Fields, out of a total population of 7.3 million). "
wantonly,,A visitor to Cambodia can see hundreds of ancient statues the Khmer Rouge wantonly defaced or broke to pieces. 
chicanery,,"This would be an arduous search that would take me into archaeology, mathematics, art, and also international intrigue and human chicanery. "
ineffectual,,"Inglis, who was later Professor of Engineering at Cambridge and was the very opposite of a ‘remote and ineffectual don’, published a paper in the Transactions of the Institution of Naval Architects whose consequences and applications extend far beyond the strength of ships. "
Salisbury,,"What Inglis said about elasticians was really very much what Lord Salisbury is supposed to have said about politicians, namely that it is a great mistake to use only small-scale maps. "
heliotrope,,"When one tries to describe a particular sensory quality, he typically resorts to reference to public things-describing a color as orange or heliotrope, a smell as like that of rotten eggs. "
Peddlers,,"Peddlers hawking street food made progress difficult, and the smells of grilled meats, dried fish, frying onions, garlic, and various spices were inescapable. "
hawking,,"Peddlers hawking street food made progress difficult, and the smells of grilled meats, dried fish, frying onions, garlic, and various spices were inescapable. "
erstwhile,,"I had an uneasy feeling that he might have been connected in some way with the French security services, perhaps keeping an eye on things in a Communist country decades after France had to abandon this erstwhile colony. "
tawny,,"The jury is still out.12 Another piece of evidence may be a passage from the Maitrāyaṇīya Upaniṣad condemning “… the tawny robed ones who convert others with rational arguments, examples and the jugglery of a false doctrine that denies the soul, and who teach a Dhamma that is destructive to the Vedas …” 13 This Upaniṣad dates from after the Buddha, although not very long after, and seems to be referring to Buddhist monks and the distinctive Buddhist doctrine of anatta, both of which presuppose the Buddha himself."
jugglery,,"The jury is still out.12 Another piece of evidence may be a passage from the Maitrāyaṇīya Upaniṣad condemning “… the tawny robed ones who convert others with rational arguments, examples and the jugglery of a false doctrine that denies the soul, and who teach a Dhamma that is destructive to the Vedas …” 13 This Upaniṣad dates from after the Buddha, although not very long after, and seems to be referring to Buddhist monks and the distinctive Buddhist doctrine of anatta, both of which presuppose the Buddha himself. "
aldermen,,"Traditionally, there were said to be eighteen guilds, and their presidents or aldermen had direct access to the king or the ruling council and sometimes even held the position of finance minister. "
animism,,"Because this animism was an informal, unstructured religion, it has left few traces of its presence, but something of it can be culled from Brahminical, Jain and Buddhist sources and to some degree from contemporary Indian folk religion. "
culled,,"Because this animism was an informal, unstructured religion, it has left few traces of its presence, but something of it can be culled from Brahminical, Jain and Buddhist sources and to some degree from contemporary Indian folk religion. "
ogre,,"These beings lurked in cemeteries, remote stretches of forests and along lonely roads, or came out at night.5 Some were benevolent, but more usually they were menacing and had to be propitiated with offerings of flowers and incense or, for the more malevolent ones, with meat and alcohol.6 A yakkha, a type of ogre, could possess people, which was a “fierce, terrible and horrifying” experience, causing the victim to cry out in alarm: “This yakkha has possessed me, harmed and hurt me, and will not let me go!” "
leapfrog,,"Conscious and unconscious play leapfrog, the conscious vaulting over the unconscious to then serve as a new unconscious foundation itself. "
empiricism,,"The Sublime The birds of the air • The best theory in the world • No logical path to it • Electricity and magnetism • Their qualities • Their quantitative laws • Ampère’s sympathetic understanding of the phenomena • Faraday’s imaginary lines of force • Maxwell’s factual field • Dodging the beasts of the field • Quantum dreams There is a delicate empiricism which makes itself utterly identical with the object, thereby becoming true theory. "
taskmaster,,"4 Not the least of the torments which plague our existence is the constant pressure of time, which never lets us so much as draw breath but pursues us all like a taskmaster with a whip. "
spiral,,"Again, if we make a thin spiral spring and also a thick and massive girder from the same material – such as steel – then the spring will naturally be very much more flexible than the girder. "
girder,,"Again, if we make a thin spiral spring and also a thick and massive girder from the same material – such as steel – then the spring will naturally be very much more flexible than the girder. "
asunder,,"5 And yet, just as our body would burst asunder if the pressure of the atmosphere were removed from it, so would the arrogance of men expand, if not to the point of bursting then to that of the most unbridled folly, indeed madness, if the pressure of want, toil, calamity and frustration were removed from their life. "
ballast,,"One can even say that we require at all times a certain quantity of care or sorrow or want, as a ship requires ballast, in order to keep on a straight course. "
blessed,,In Buddhism the world arises as a consequence of an inexplicable clouding of the heavenly clarity of the blessed state of Nirvana after a long period of quietude. 
untrammelled,,"Many books, moreover, serve merely to show how many ways there are of being wrong, and how far astray you yourself would go if you followed their guidance. – You should read only when your own thoughts dry up, which will of course happen frequently enough even to the best heads; but to banish your own thoughts so as to take up a book is a sin against the Holy Ghost; it is like deserting untrammelled nature to look at a herbarium or engravings of landscapes. "
mark,,8 The characteristic mark of minds of the first rank is the immediacy of all their judgements. 
immediacy,,8 The characteristic mark of minds of the first rank is the immediacy of all their judgements. 
plummet,,"It is to this that every explanation, through few or many intermediate stages, leads; as the plummet touches the bottom of the sea now at a greater depth, now at a less, but is bound to reach it somewhere sooner or later. "
attenuating,,"Each hallmark ideally satisfies three criteria: it rises with age, enhancing it speeds aging, and attenuating it slows aging in model organisms. "
luminaries,,"By studying the heavenly bodies, however, the Babylonian priests soon found the luminaries to be superior omens from which they could efficiently anticipate natural phenomena and their accompanying significant events. "
trenchant,,"The book was denounced as blasphemous and La Mettrie had to flee from Paris to Leiden, where in 1747 he published an even more trenchant defense of the mechanical view of life, L’homme machine (Man, a Machine). "
rarefied,,"If you are able to carry this rarefied notion of division from the world of skyscrapers back to the much more abstract world of groups, then you will have some feel for what “dividing” a group by one of its subgroups is all about. "
temerity,,"Millikan even had the temerity to declare in his article that Einstein himself no longer believed in his own “erroneous theory” about light (a pure speculation on Millikan’s part, without the slightest basis in fact). "
a,,"er:             That a principle of such broad generality [namely, Galilean relativity] should hold with such exactness in one domain of phenomena [namely, mechanics], and yet should be invalid for another [namely, electrodynamics], is a priori not very probable. "
priori,,":             That a principle of such broad generality [namely, Galilean relativity] should hold with such exactness in one domain of phenomena [namely, mechanics], and yet should be invalid for another [namely, electrodynamics], is a priori not very probable. "
scurrilous,,"His narrative was no sober account of intellectual endeavor, but full of scurrilous details, not least about his own libidinous exploits. "
regaled,,"A lesser-known fabrication, however, is Watson’s claim (which he only recently admitted was pure invention) that, when he and Crick finally realized what the structure of the DNA molecule must be, Crick regaled the occupants of The Eagle pub in Cambridge, the duo’s favorite watering hole, with the claim that they had discovered “the secret of life.” "
melding,,"By completing the melding of modern genetics with traditional Darwinism, the discovery of the structure of DNA and the consequent understanding of how genetic information is apparently encoded and copied at the molecular scale made it seem that the story of life was complete from bottom to top, absent the intervening details that only specialists cared about. "
intervening,,"By completing the melding of modern genetics with traditional Darwinism, the discovery of the structure of DNA and the consequent understanding of how genetic information is apparently encoded and copied at the molecular scale made it seem that the story of life was complete from bottom to top, absent the intervening details that only specialists cared about. "
conscientious,,"Barbara was confident, Christine conscientious. "
sidestep,,"To be clear, AlphaFold does not so much solve the infamously difficult protein-folding problem as sidestep it. "
sulk,,Especially if you sulk and don’t make eye contact. 
Preamble,,‘Our Preamble uses the word “secular”. 
mendicants,,"fore the Buddha’s time, was that of a class of ascetics most commonly called samaṇas .16 These ascetics were also known variously as wanderers (paribbājaka), because of their homelessness; ford-makers (titthaṅkara), because they were endeavouring to find or claimed to have found a way to cross the raging river of conditioned existence; mendicants (bhikkhu or piṇḍola), because they begged for alms; or silent ones (muni), for their penchant for being quiet and retiring. "
matted,,"They were usually identified by their matted hair (jaṭila) and the deer skins (ajina) they wore.25 However, seemingly unable to completely let go of worldly life as traditional samaṇas did, some spent the day at the edge of their village or in the nearby forest tending the sacred fire and returned to their homes in the evening, while others lived permanently in the forest but kept their wives and childr"

promulgated,,"It is the Noble Eightfold Path”.29 The Buddha’s immediate predecessor was Kassapa Buddha, again possibly a real person although with legends built around his life and doctrines attributed to him which he may or may not have promulgated.   "
nostrums,,"There are places in the Tipitaka where the Buddha berated those samaṇas who preyed on people’s devotion or gullibility by claiming to be able to predict the future and interpret dreams and omens, or who practised astrology, or dispensed nostrums “while living off food provided by the faithful”.33 One of the people the Buddha was having a discussion with described the discourses of many ordinary ascetics and brahmins as nothing more than chitter chatter (vilāpaṃ vilapitaṃ).34 A few samaṇas were prepared to pander to the powerful in the hope of obtaining their patronage, and for their part the pow"
interlocutors,,"IV, 429. 85 a t e a c h e r o f g o d s a n d h u m a n s good one”.19 Such encouragement meant that questions and comments kept coming, giving interlocutors the opportunity to express their views and the Buddha the opportunity to formulate his answers in a way that took into account their views. "
in,,"It is good for the eyes, the breath does not smell, the taste buds are cleansed, bile and phlegm do not mix with the food, and one’s food is appreciated”.34 In one extraordinary passage, surely unique in religious literature, he said that when he was travelling and needed to defecate or urinate, he would look up and down the road to make sure no one was coming before relieving himself.35 There is a brief description of the Buddha standing in a bathing robe drying himself after having bathed in the Achivaratī River at the Eastern Bathing Ghat, just beyond  "
abiding,,"Saccaka was not impressed by this and sniffed: “Some would call that abiding in delusion”.41 During such naps the Buddha would lie down in what he called the lion posture: reclining on his right side, with one foot on the other. "
enema,,Being oiled could mean one of several things: being massaged with medicinal oil; ingesting such oil; putting drops of it in the nose or ears; or having it administered as an enema—all treatments mentioned in early Aryuvedic texts. 
buffeted,,"When I’m the one in the passenger seat, I want to believe that no one better could be sitting behind the controls of that plane as it jerks and shudders, buffeted by headwinds. "

phrenology,,"One attempt to subdivide the brain came from Franz Josef Gall, who founded the school of phrenology. "
Anschluss,,"Schrödinger arrived at Trinity College Dublin from Austria in 1938, an exile after the Nazi Anschluss—he had been a vocal opponent of Hitler’s regime, and his wife was classified as non-Aryan. "
Wary,,Wary [LME] is from the same root. awe [OE] The battle plan
scrotal,,Bartholomew’s Hospital named Percivall Pott noticed a marked rise in cases of scrotal cancer in his clinic. 
indentured,,"His patients were almost invariably chimney sweeps or “climbing-boys”—poor, indentured orphans apprenticed to sweeps and sent up into chimneys to clean the flues of ash, often nearly naked and swathed in oil. "
exasperated,,"I never saw it under the age of puberty, which is, I suppose, one reason why it is generally taken, both by patient and surgeon, for venereal; and being treated with mercurials, is thereby soon and much exasperated.” "
numinous,,"If soot, and not some mystical, numinous humor (à la Galen), caused scrotal cancer, then two facts had to be true. "
asphyxiation,,"By an odd stroke of luck, Oliver is spared from being sold to Gamfield, who has already sent two previous apprentices to their deaths by asphyxiation in chimneys.) "
The,,"The metaphor of infection is particularly apposite, since cigarette smoking soon spread like a fierce contagion through all those nations and then leapt across the Atlantic to America. "

becomes,,"And when a risk factor for a disease becomes so highly prevalent in a population, it paradoxically begins to disappear into the white noise of the background. "
asking,,"As the Oxford epidemiologist Richard Peto put it: “By the early 1940s, asking about a connection between tobacco and cancer was like asking about an association between sitting and cancer.” "
indelible,,"But for Wynder, who had never encountered such a case before, the image of cancer growing out of that soot-stained lung was indelible; the link was virtually staring him in the face. "
brusquely,,He was brusquely told that the effort would be “futile.” 
Thwarted,,"Thwarted in his attempts to convince the surgeon general’s office, Wynder recruited an unlikely but powerful mentor in St. "
culled,,Patients with lung cancer (“cases”) versus patients admitted for other illnesses (“controls”) were culled from twenty hospitals in and around London and interviewed by a social worker in a hospital. 
Carcinoma,,"In September of that year, their seminal study, “Smoking and Carcinoma of the Lung,” was published in the British Medical Journal. "
retrospective,,"But this proof is retrospective and indirect; that three evolutionary stages exist suggests, but cannot prove, that one fossil had caused the genesis of the next. "
effeminate,,"(The iconic Marlboro Man, with his hypermasculine getup of lassos and tattoos, was an elaborate decoy set up to prove that there was nothing effeminate or sissy about smoking filter-tipped cigarettes.) "
speciousness,,The speciousness began right from its opening lines: “Recent reports on experiments with mice have given wide publicity to a theory that cigarette smoking is in some way linked with lung cancer in human beings.” 
protracted,,"In January 1954, after a protracted search, the TIRC announced that it had finally chosen a director, who had—as the institute never failed to remind the public—been ushered in from the deepest realms of science. "
livid,,"Graham, who knew Little from his days at the ASCC, was livid. "
rococo,,"For scientific purists, this seemed rococo—and, like all things rococo, all too easy to mock: imagine a mathematician or physicist choosing from a “menu” of nine criteria to infer causality. "
preponderance,,"Often, like the weight of proof in a detective case, the preponderance of small bits of evidence, rather than a single definitive experiment, clinched cause. "
obstinacy,,"“The obstinacy of [policymakers],” he wrote, “compels one to conclude that it is their own addiction . . . which blinds them. "
distal,,"Therefore, charge that enters a cell can leak out before spreading out equally within the cell, causing charge imbalances within the cell, so the potential difference across the cell membrane in its distal dendrites (figure 1.2) can be quite different from that in the soma. "
peck,,"I had spent the next year, even after I started awkwardly dating Kim, hanging around Vika at parties, doing her favors, buying her lunches and concert tickets, occasionally rewarded by a drunken peck good night, always left hoping for more. "
woozy,,I wasn’t just woozy.

androgynous,,"My rescuer, I hoped, was tall, maybe thirty, androgynous, with a shock of short blue hair, wearing a black puffy jacket. "
sigil,,"It had been a considerable surprise to find it in a corner of our basement closet when searching for my ski boots: a lacquered black box as big as a large toolbox, unadorned except for the ornate lock on one side and an inlaid silver sigil, highly stylized with loops and curlicues, on the other. "
shuttered,,8 GRACE Nearly half of the storefronts south of Dwight were shuttered or for rent. 
insalubrious,,"I knew times were hard, the tent cities growing like fungal infections in every insalubrious corner of the Bay Area made that apparent, but the pandemic was behind us now, and if you believed the GDP numbers, the worst of the recession was too. "
aughts,,I was suddenly grateful for the stupid nickname I had been burdened with in the aughts. 
bereft,,"Had they grown up in comfortable homes, worked decent jobs, thought themselves content, even wealthy, until the pandemic, or a sudden divorce, or a medical crisis, sent them plummeting, bereft, through America’s one-way downwardly mobile trapdoor? "

diacritic,,The names ending in ‘a’ without the diacritic must be read as अ. 
coterie,,"Duryodhana was supported by a willing coterie of younger brothers and allies patronised by him, and the eventual compliance, even if unwilling, of the elders of Hastināpur, especially Bhishma, Dronāchārya and Kripāchārya. "
anguish,,He feels acute anguish for he believes he has presided over the death of his own brethren and elders who deserved his respect. 
fissures,,"A king who has spies spread out far and wide to collect all kinds of information about the opponents and whose spies can win over the opponent’s people and create fissures in their kingdoms is acclaimed by all.30 A king should appoint as his ministers and officers those who are courageous, loyal, incorruptible, born in good families, healthy, disciplined, keep good company, possess self-respect while not being disrespectful to others, learned in scriptures as well a"
Those,,"Those arising out of anger are—backbiting, reckless action, rebelling without a cause, jealousy, resentment, destroying someone’s wealth, roughness in speech and giving intense punishment. "
backbiting,,"Those arising out of anger are—backbiting, reckless action, rebelling without a cause, jealousy, resentment, destroying someone’s wealth, roughness in speech and giving intense punishment. "
reviling,,"Those arising out of passion are—hunting, gambling, sleeping during the day, reviling others, sexual excesses, intoxication (by drugs), playing or listening to musical instruments, singing or hearing songs, dancing and alcoholism. "
despondent,,"At the party, employees grew more and more despondent and agitated. "
untenable,,The combination would make an OpenAI without Altman untenable. 
unraveling,,"After three days embedded among employees and dozens of interviews, I could see that the experiment in idealistic governance was unraveling. "
espoused,,"Musk found him to be smart, driven, and, most important, someone who espoused like-minded views on the need to carefully develop and govern artificial intelligence. "
countervailing,,"After spending many hours with Altman to profile him in 2016, The New Yorker’s Tad Friend would note this duality: On any given issue, Altman seemed as driven by a relentless desire to push ahead as he was attuned to the countervailing need for caution. "
presumption,,"While spiking the narrative with some lively debate, this explorational approach also has the advantage of mitigating my presumption in venturing, gownless, onto the campus sward. "
reek,,"er office building is taken over by terrorists — Die Hard A businessman falls in love with a hooker he hires to be his date for the weekend — Pretty Woman I don't know about you, but I think both of these loglines, one from a drama, one from a romantic comedy, fairly reek of irony. "
whence,,"The Aryans, on the other hand, they of that rich Sanskrit literary heritage whence all knowledge of India’s ancient past was traditionally derived, are in retreat. "
doyenne,,"‘It is doubtful whether the term arya was ever used in an ethnic sense,’ writes Romila Thapar, doyenne of ancient India’s historians.1 What she calls the ‘Aryan problem’, or ‘myth’, is now to be regarded as ‘perhaps the biggest red herring that was dragged across the path of India’s historians’."
stomping,,"Once a child is taught that plants are alive, they can readily tell those apart from nonliving things and act accordingly—for example, not stomping on the flower bed but perhaps jumping in the mud instead. "
jeer,,"TOLKIEN   “The best way to drive out the devil, if he will not yield to texts of Scripture, is to jeer and flout him, for he cannot bear scorn.”—Luther “The devill.. the prowde spirite.. cannot endure to be mocked.”—Thomas More"

expurgated,,He thinks his conversion is something inside him and his attention is therefore chiefly turned at present to the states of his own mind—or rather to that very expurgated version of them which is all you should allow him to see. 
supplication,,"One of their poets, Coleridge, has recorded that he did not pray “with moving lips and bended knees” but merely “composed his spirit to love” and indulged “a sense of supplication”. "
dissipative,,"17] There are somewhat similar dissipative structures on the surface of the Earth too—what we call hurricanes, which like the Great Red Spot are storms with high winds that self-organize into a temporarily persistent spiral shape. "
Dolomites,,"From the Majestic Dolomites to Gentle Bloomington I started writing my chapter in a quiet and simple hotel room in the beautiful Alpine village of Anterselva di Mezzo, located in the Italian Dolomites, only a few stone’s throws from the Austrian border. "
written,,"But when they finally received it, Ken and Uriah were very pleased with what I had written and were most tolerant of my indiscretions; indeed, so keen were they to have a contribution from me in their book that they said they could accept an extra-long chapter, and Ken in particular helped me cut it down to half its length, which was a real labor of love on his part.

Pangloss,,"“Pig” starts off lightly and amusingly — a naïve young man named Lexington, raised as a strict vegetarian by his Aunt Glosspan (“Pangloss” reversed), discovers after her death that he loves the taste of meat (though he doesn’t know what it is that he’s eating). "

against,,"But Bayard has never heard of Fritz the Cat, the countercultural cartoon strip and film, in which black people are saxophone-playing crows and the hero is a cat in a turtleneck who, Kerouac-style, smokes joints and fucks anything that moves in Cadillacs, against a backdrop of urban riots and burning Dumpsters.

Dumpsters,,"But Bayard has never heard of Fritz the Cat, the countercultural cartoon strip and film, in which black people are saxophone-playing crows and the hero is a cat in a turtleneck who, Kerouac-style, smokes joints and fucks anything that moves in Cadillacs, against a backdrop of urban riots and burning Dumpsters. "
pastiche,,"Bayard more or less understands the satirical intent and also that in theory he ought to be on the same wavelength as the authors of this pastiche, but he is wary. "
Chief,,"Chief among the tenets of the fledgling field, at least as far as Galton was concerned, was the importance and primacy of data. "

mauve,,"At the other end of the room, the guy in mauve lizard-skin boots is telling his young disciples about the events of May ’68, which, in his account, sound like a mixture of Mad Max and Woodstock. "
phlogiston,,"The almost universal assumption is that modern computational and dynamical approaches to these subjects have made these concepts as anachronistic as phlogiston.6 So the idea of allowing the potentially achievable consequence characterizing a function, a reference, or an intended goal to play a causal role in our explanations of physical change has become"

unwieldy,,"Even before Leibniz, variety or diversity was one aspect on which the theologians of Spanish late scholasticism in the seventeenth century, otherwise prone to rather dry and unwieldy arguments, could become astonishingly specific. "
moot,,"But the “Egyptian Plan,” which anticipates the idea of the Suez Canal but never reaches the ears of the French monarch, becomes moot when, soon after its drafting, France attacks the Netherlands.4 Oh well, Leibniz thinks to himself, the main thing is to be in Paris, which, alongside London, is a center of science and culture in Europe.

caprices,,"To his friend Christian Habbaeus von Lichtenstern, who had been trying to secure the position for him, he wrote that he was not accustomed to subjecting himself to “the political caprices of this or that great lord.” "
leery,,"Some theologians and pious individuals are leery of the new approaches in infinitesimal mathematics; to them, all this talk of infinity sure seems to contradict the conception of God’s creation as finite and ordered. "
putatively,,And it seems a dangerously short step from the dictates of reason to a dictatorship in the name of the putatively rational. 
albeit,,"For Leibniz’s thought doesn’t just assume that flies, like humans, possess a kind of consciousness, albeit one of a much lower order. "
Acapulco,,This precious Asian bounty has been brought here from Manila by way of Acapulco. 
Florida,,But the sailors are still waiting for the favorable winds that will allow them to take advantage of the Florida current and the Gulf Stream. 
Hanover,,"With about ten thousand residents, Hanover was a small town compared to Paris. "
Gladstonian,,"By the end of 1921 he was, if not an ally, at least the co-belligerent of his brother Ramanathan and men like Ambalavanar Kanagasabhai.6 Their narrow outlook and conservative politics would have appalled him before he began his drift to their camp; a man with a radical outlook and a strong social conscience, he had remained a Gladstonian liberal throughout his public career. "
panache,,It was an astute choice since Arunachalam did not relish the transition from national to communal leadership and could not have filled the latter role with the conviction and panache which Ramanathan was to demonstrate. 
conceded,,"There was little doubt now that with the appointment of the Donoughmore Commission, a further and substantial measure of constitutional reform was about to be conceded. "

the,,"The Bible is a 1 2 t h e b i b l e   central book in our culture, just as the Koran is central in other nations. "
azimuthal,,"But we could also specify the same point by measuring r, the distance from a radial segment from the origin to the point; θ (Greek “theta”), the polar angle between that radial segment and the z-axis; and φ (Greek “phi”), the azimuthal angle between the x-axis and the projection of our point down to the xy-plane.

promenade,,Australians do not sit at pavement cafes to watch the promenade. 
wowser,,"Noting that organized religion was on the wane, he sensed the persistence of a ‘wowser’ effect in Australian society that was a carryover from the days of morality being dictated from the pulpit. "
its,,"But he had no way of knowing that Catholicism would become the dominant Christian denomination, that Anglicanism would fade (he called it ‘Church of England’ of course: the Anglican label wasn’t adopted until 1981) or that religious fundamentalism, especially of the Pentecostalist variety, would surge at the turn of the century with its ‘prosperity theology’ perfectly tuned to the rampant materialism of the times.

scarcely,,"Just look over the sections of The Lucky Country called ‘Cultural Breakthrough’ and ‘Images of Life’ and contemplate where we have come since the 1950s, when there was no Australian film industry, little Australian drama, only a few writers, not many historians, and scarcely any quality media.

people,,Perhaps what attracted a lot of people to it was that the tensions of Australia in the 1960s seemed to take it over as it was being written (perhaps making it a better book than the one first planned); it brought together most of the present frustrations and conflicts of Australians; and people can disagree with some of the views of events given in it and nevertheless agree that the right problems have been set.

quagmires,,"I have been struggling through these thickets and quagmires for over fifty years, and I have found a path that takes us all the way to a satisfactory—and satisfying—account of how the “magic” of our minds is accomplished without any magic, but it is neither straight nor easy. "

exuberant,,"Douglas Hofstadter’s book, I Am a Strange Loop (2007), describes a mind composing itself in cycles of processing that loop around, twisting and feeding on themselves, creating exuberant reactions to reflections to reminders to reevaluations that generate novel structures: ideas, fantasies, theories, and, yes, thinking tools to create still more.

currying,,"In 486 the consul Spurius Cassius proposed an allotment of captured lands among the poor; the patricians accused him of currying popular favor with a view to making himself king, and had him killed; this was probably not the first in a long line of agrarian proposals and Senatorial assassinations, culminating in the Gracchi and Caesar.

precept,,"A girl I knew (and whose clothes I removed) in high school used to sing “Il faut souffrir pour être belle” in a soft voice, to a tune of her own devising, and I took that overheard precept seriously; I was willing to understand it not just in the narrow sense of painful hair-brushing or (say) eyebrow-tweezing or liposuction, but in some broader sense that suffering makes for beauty in art, that the artist has to suffer griefs and privations in order to deliver beauty to his or her public, all that well-ventilated junk.

libel,,"Marx doesn’t argue about it; he simply brands the Malthusian doctrine “a libel on the human race”—after all, the proletariat, which is to be the ruling class of the future, cannot be so shortsighted as to dissipate its gains through mere unbridled physical appetite. "
gleans,,"But since he must substitute machinery for labor, he must also narrow the base out of which he gleans his profits. "

Grecian,,“Sailing to Byzantium” invokes a yearning for immortality through a journey to a mythical Byzantium where the poet imagines himself transformed into a gold statue: “such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make/Of hammered gold and gold enameling/To keep a drowsy emperor awake.” 
while,,"But what I wish to emphasize is that, while we can blame or commiserate these individuals, as we choose, for not maintaining or cultivating, or for not having had the opportunity to cultivate and maintain, the requisite sensibility, it is, very strictly speaking, meaningless—unless by way of a forcible hyperbole—to accuse them of mistaking something that ‘is’ poetry for something that ‘is not’.

promontories,,Before him lies a fog-shrouded landscape in which the fantastic shapes of more distant promontories are only partly visible. 
countermanding,,"Thucydides also shows us, though, that there are exceptions to any rule: when the Mityleneans rebel and the Athenians conquer them, the strong suddenly have second thoughts and send out a second ship to overtake the first, countermanding the order to slaughter or enslave the weak.21 This tension between particularization and generalization—between literal and abstract representation—comes with the territory, I think, when you’re transmitting vicarious experience.

the,,"Today, we’re all familiar with the fact that if you draw two lines at right angles that are precisely one inch long, and draw a line between them, that line’s length will be the square root of two inches long, which is an irrational number – a number that can’t be expressed as the ratio of two integers.

Panglossian,,To this general philosophy Edgeworth now added the precision of mathematics to produce a kind of Panglossian Best of All Possible Worlds.

arrant,,"The Utopians went there because what they were talking about was arrant nonsense and wasn’t “economics” anyway, and finally anyone went there whose doctrines failed to accord with the elegant world that the academicians erected in their classrooms and fondly believed existed outside them.

dubious,,"The Romans called the technique dubitatio, as in “dubious.” "
bailiwick,,"Pathos tends to work poorly in the beginning of an argument, when you need to make the audience understand what you want and trust your character; that’s the bailiwick of logos and ethos. "

tarp,,He spread the small tarp they used for a table on the ground and laid everything out and he took the pistol from his belt and laid it on the cloth and then he just sat watching the boy sleep. 
sassy,,"Think of feisty romance heroines, hard-boiled detectives, save-the-world suspense heroes, fantasy orphan-princes, sassy vampire slayers ... these familiar lead characters cannot hold our interest over the long haul of a novel if they are one-dimensional. "

repose,,"Its aim is to mark within the progression of things the moment in which rights succeeded violence, and nature was subjected to law; to explain by what sequence of miracles the powerful might resolve to serve the weak and the people purchase an imaginary repose at the price of true happiness. "
suckle,,"I also note, on the subject of infancy, that a mother, carrying her child with her everywhere, can feed it with much greater ease than the females of many other species that are forced to exhaust themselves going back and forth, on one side to find food, on the other to suckle or feed their young. "
depraved,,"If nature destined us to be healthy, I almost dare to assume that a contemplative state is one contrary to nature, and that a man who reflects is a depraved animal.24 When one thinks of the good condition that savages are in, at least those we have not ruined with our strong liquor, when one discerns that they barely know any illnesses other than injury and old age, one is very much led to believe that one could map the history of human illness by following the diseases of civil societies.

tort,,"Some scholars have predicted a decline in common-law rules of property, tort, contract, and family law as legislators grow more bold in these areas. "
felicitous,,"Locke avoided such a dark view, arguing instead that life in the state of nature was fundamentally felicitous, and that the state was necessary only because certain people would never recognize the rights of others to “life, health, liberty, or possessions.” "
phantasm,,"It being that term, which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding, when a man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm, notion, species, or whatever it is, which the mind can be employed about in thinking; and I could not avoid frequently using it.A I presume it will be easily granted me, that there are such ideas in men’s minds; everyone is conscious of them in himself, and men’s words and actions will satisfy him, that they are in others. "
impertinent,,"For I imagine anyone will easily grant, that it would be impertinent to suppose, the ideas of colours innate in a creature, to whom God hath given sight, and a power to receive them by the eyes, from external objects: and no less unreasonable would it be to attribute several truths, to the impressions of nature, and innate characters, when we may observe in ourselves faculties, fit to attain as easy and certain knowledge of them, as if they were originally imprinted on the mind.

gaffe,,"He has committed a gaffe, a social error, and has thereby dishonored both his regiment and himself within the regiment: “At our mess table every piece of idiocy on the part of any one of us was chewed over for the next ten or twenty years.” "
imperious,,Edith is narcissistic and imperious — a diva of pain. 
swerve,,"I also use the illustration of a mattress on the highway that jams up the traffic; everyone waits in line to swerve around it, wondering what the trouble is, but when that person finally does swerve around it, he has no incentive to park and remove the mattress. "

palladium,,"When an intrepid commodities player negotiated the purchase of the Russian government’s entire stock of nongold precious metals, leverage mattered less than the security around the armored train that was to bring the palladium from Siberia. "
antihero,,"He had been a rising star at Goldman Sachs, but he opted for the freedom and rewards of running his own shop; a man who collects plastic superheroes is not going to remain a salaried antihero for long, at least not if he can help it. "
swashbuckling,,"The funds that Swensen invested in were certainly diverse: In 2002, a swashbuckling West Coast fund named Farallon swooped into Indonesia and bought the country’s largest bank, undeterred by the fact that a currency collapse, a political revolution, and Islamist extremism had scared most westerners out of the country. "
yank,,"Hedge funds were reliant upon the patience of their investors, who could yank their money out on short notice. "
insular,,"The 2004 essay complained of hedge funds that “in addition to being arrogant and insular, they’re also clandestine.” "
purser,,"Having inherited the wanderlust of his father, he signed on as a purser on a tramp steamer and spent a year touring the world. "

interminable,,"But run them through the cogs and wheels of the language machine, let it arrange them in some very special orders, and there is nothing that these meaningless streams of air cannot do: from sighing the interminable ennui of existence (‘not tonight, Josephine’) to unravelling the fundamental order of the universe (‘every body perseveres2 in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon’).

levelheaded,,"was said that you could walk the famous canyons near the stock exchange and hear only the rattle of backgammon dice through the open windows.15 But what is striking about Jones, given his youthful adventures with the undercover Left, is that he emerged from this turmoil more levelheaded than before. "
fizzled,,"21 But, now in his late forties, with two children and expensive New York tastes, he decided that he needed money.22 His efforts to earn more in journalism had fizzled: He had left the staff of Fortune hoping to launch a new magazine, but two blueprints had failed to attract financial backing. "
Stymied,,"Stymied in these publishing ventures, Jones moved to plan B. "
dapper,,"He rented space from an insurance business owned by one of his investors, Winslow Carlton, a dapper man who favored blue shirts with white collars and tightly knotted ties and who drove a magnificent Packard convertible. "
resplendent,,"Some mornings in those early years, Carlton would have his resplendent vehicle brought out of its garage, and he would drive over to Jones’s apartment at 30 Sutton Place, and the two of them would proceed down the East Side with the roof off, trading predictions about the market. "
pique,,"There is nothing like secrecy to pique the public’s curiosity, and by the mid-1960s, hedge funds had begun to attract the sort of breathless commentary that later grew commonplace. "
squawkers,,"In the Wall Street of the 1950s and 1960s, information did not reach everyone at once: There were no blast e-mails from brokers, no instant analysis from cable TV squawkers. "
The,,"The analyst, a future Wall Street grandee named Barton Biggs, took instantly against Jones, and although he accepted the opportunity to run a model portfolio for his fund, he never grew to like him. "

flustered,,"The sight of him sitting so close made me feel both happy and flustered, and I could think of little or nothing to say. "
bespoke,,"We parted fondly, and with a sense of elation on my part: his every word bespoke goodwill, and I felt that he had my best interests at heart. "
eschatology,,"Reimarus argued that Jesus can only be regarded and understood not as the founder of Christianity, but as the final and dominant figure in the mystical eschatology of the Jews—i.e., Christ thought not of establishing a new religion, but of preparing men for the imminent destruction of the world, and God’s Last Judgment of all souls. "

synoptic,,"The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are “synoptic”: their contents and episodes allow of being arranged in parallel columns and “viewed together.” "
Essenes,,"He shared the asceticism of the Essenes, but differed from them in holding one baptism to be enough; his name “the Baptist” may be a Greek equivalent of “Essene” (bather) .38 To his rite of symbolic purification John added a menacing condemnation of hypocrisy and loose living, warned sinners to prep"
fomenting,,Josephus attributes the arrest to Herod’s fear that John was fomenting a political rebellion in the guise of a religious reformation.42 Mark
Salome,,"Mark43 and Matthew44 tell here the story of Salome, Herodias’ daughter, who danced so alluringly before Herod that he offered her any reward she might name. "
comeliness,,"We have no portrait of him, nor do the evangelists describe him; but he must have had some physical comeliness, as well as spiritual magnetism, to attract so many women as well as men. "
tunic,,"We gather from stray words54 that, like other men of that age and land, he wore a tunic under a cloak, had sandals on his feet, and probably a cloth headdress falling over his shoulders to shield him from the sun.55 Many women sensed in him a sympathetic tenderness that aroused in them an unstinted devotion. "
Sadducees,,"Generally, however, he moved among the poor, even among the almost untouchable Amhaarez so scorned and shunned by Sadducees and Pharisees alike. "
Pharisees,,"Generally, however, he moved among the poor, even among the almost untouchable Amhaarez so scorned and shunned by Sadducees and Pharisees alike. "
workable,,"We have even reduced the eighteenth-century vision of human equality, glorious if false, to a more workable twentieth-century interpretation, mediocrity, inglorious if real. "
promontory,,"As in Western thought various tides have swept this bay, assaulted that promontory, or, receding, have bared undistinguished flats, so we have turned now to gods, now to God, again to nature and its laws for satisfying answers. "
fuchsia,,"Partnerships were established -- what zoologists call symbiosis -- so that the fuchsia, for example, offered the hummingbird nectar in exchange for hauling fuchsia pollen around. "
quantum,,"In a notable issue of the Scientific American (September 1960) he presented as Scripture: There is a quantum difference, at points a complete opposition, between even the most rudimentary human society and the most advanced subhuman primate one. "
revolutionist,,"Since this would be the profoundest of all revolutions, beside which all others would be mere coups d’état of class ousting class and exploiting in its turn, Christ was in this spiritual sense the greatest revolutionist in history. "
feeling,,"103† Nevertheless, he transformed everything by the force of his character and his feeling. "
injunction,,"He added to the Law the injunction to prepare for the Kingdom by a life of justice, kindliness, and simplicity. "
lest,,"The priests of the Temple and the members of the Sanhedrin watched his activity with suspicion; like Herod with John, they saw in it the semblance or cover of a political revolution; they feared lest the Roman procurator should accuse them of neglecting their responsibility for maintaining social order. "
scourge,,"In a burst of indignation he and his followers overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the dove merchants, scattered their coins on the ground, and with “a scourge of rods” drove the traders from the court. "
Seder,,"On the fourteenth day of the Jewish month of Nisan (our April third), probably in the year 30,* Jesus and his apostles ate the Seder, or Passover supper, in the home of a friend in Jerusalem. "
extortion,,"Pontius Pilate was a hard man, who would later be summoned to Rome, accused of extortion and cruelty,131 and removed from office. "
procurator,,"asked the procurator133—a question perhaps due to the metaphysical propensities of the Fourth Gospel, but well revealing the chasm between the sophisticated and cynical culture of the Roman and the warm and trustful idealism of the Jew. "
stupefying,,"Even the Romans sometimes pitied the victim, and offered him a stupefying drink. "
reviled,,"Mark reports that two robbers were crucified with Jesus, and “reviled him”;137 Luke assures us that one of them prayed to him."
myrrh,,"thy of the Jewish populace—that “all the people that came together to that sight . . . smote their breasts and returned” to the town.141 Two kindly and influential Jews, having secured Pilate’s permission, took the body down from the cross, embalmed it with aloes and myrrh, and placed it in a tomb.

Sanhedrin,,"Peter and others were arrested and questioned by the Sanhedrin; the Sadducees wished to condemn them to death, but a Pharisee named Gamaliel—probably the teacher of Paul—advised a suspended judgment; as a compromise the prisoners were flogged and released. "

nightmare,,"For instance, you sitting there may be merely my dream, and I may be your nightmare. "

ward,,"Fanny is an adopted child, an impecunious niece, a gentle ward (notice that her mother's maiden name was Ward). "
coy,,"The middle-class flutter of the event (""good luck to captivate"") is delightfully conveyed here and will give the right tone to the next pages where money affairs predominate over romantic and religious ones with a kind of coy simplicity.["
regent,,"He reigned from 1760 to 1820, a longish time, by the end of which the good man was mostly in a state of insanity and the regent, another George, had taken over. "

impecunious,,"Fanny's mother, the rather insipid Miss Frances Ward, also called Fanny, in 1781 married, out of spite, an impecunious hard-drinking lieutenant and had in all ten children, of whom Fanny, the heroine of the book, was the second. "

profusion,,"Nevertheless, the depth and sincerity of their feeling, their angry devotion to a great cause, their profusion of noble and memorable speech make them the most forceful and eloquent letters in all literature; even Cicero’s charm seems slight beside this passionate faith. "
backsliders,,"Here are strong words of love from one to whom his churches were his fiercely protected children; violent attacks upon his numberless enemies; reprimands to sinners, backsliders, and divisive disputants; and everywhere tender exhortations. "

evocation,,"In Search of Lost Time is an evocation, not a description of the past, as Arnaud Dandieu, a French critic, has remarked. "
underscoring,,"""I could hear the whistling of trains, which, now nearer and now farther off, underscoring the distance like the note of a bird in a forest, unfolded for me in perspective the deserted countryside through which a traveller would be hurrying towards the nearest station: the path that he followed being fixed forever in his memory by the general excitement due to being in a strange place, to doing unusual things, to the last words of conversation, to farewells exchanged beneath an unfamiliar lamp which echoed still in his ears amid the silence of the night; and to the deligh"
grotesque,,"Gogol's comparison is always grotesque, a parody of Homer, and his metaphors are nightmares, whereas Proust's are dreams. "
atoning,,"Moved by his own somber spirit and remorse, and his transforming vision of Christ; influenced perhaps by Platonist and Stoic denunciations of matter and the body as evil; recalling, it may be, Jewish and pagan customs of sacrificing a “scapegoat” for the sins of the people, Paul created a theology of which none but the vaguest warrants can be found in the words of Christ: that every man born of woman inherits the guilt of Adam, and can be saved from eternal damnation only by the atoning death of the Son of God."
Antioch,,"Eleutherios (Deliverer) had been applied to these deities; and the word Kyrios (Lord), used by Paul of Christ, was the term given in Syrian-Greek cults to the dying and redeeming Dionysus.52 The gentiles of Antioch and other Greek cities, never having known Jesus in the flesh, could only accept him after the manner of their savior gods. "
bestirred,,"God chooses from all eternity those whom he will bless with his grace, and those whom he will damn.56 Nevertheless, Paul bestirred himself to awaken faith as a rod to catch God’s grace; only through such “assurance of things longed for,” such “confidence in things unseen,”57 can the soul experience that profound change which makes a new man, unites the believer with Christ, and allows"
concupiscence,,"64 Virginity is better than marriage, but marriage is better than concupiscence. "

Jewry,,"Because the Law of the Pentateuch was written, it could not meet all the needs and circumstances of a Jerusalem without freedom, or a Judaism without Jerusalem, or a Jewry without Palestine. "
apprised,,"Upon getting to New York’s Kennedy airport, you are apprised by the airline agent that the flights to London are canceled, sorry, delays due to backlog due to weather problems, that type of thing. "
profuse,,"Swann is introduced: ""we heard, from the far end of the garden, not the profuse and shrill bell which drenched and stunned with its icy, rusty, interminable sound any passing member of the household who set it going by pushing through 'without ringing,' but the double peal—timid, oval, golden—of the visitor's bell.... and then, soon after, my grandfather would say: 'I can hear Swann's voice.' ...

anguish,,"He imagines that Swann would have laughed heartily could he have seen the contents of the letter to his mother, ""whereas, on the contrary, as I was to learn in due course, a similar anguish had been the bane of his life for many years, and no one perhaps could have understood my feelings at that moment so well as himself; to him, that anguish which lies in knowing that the creature one adores is in some place of enjoyment where oneself is not and cannot follow—to him that anguish came through Love, to which it is in a sense predestined, by which it must be taken over and specialized....
